                        Release Notes for
                   P4V, the Perforce Visual Client
                         Version 2015.2


Introduction
        P4V is an end-user application designed for software developers.

        Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCC, for example
        2002.2/30547. YYYY is the year; R is the release of that
        year; CCCCC is the bug fix change level. Each bug fix in these
        release notes is marked by its change number. Any build
        includes (1) all bug fixes for all previous releases and (2)
        all bug fixes for the current release up to the bug fix change
        level.

        Notes:
            P4V is build on top of Qt, a cross platform application framework.
            In version 2014.2 of P4V we migrated the code from Qt4 to Qt5. This is
            a significant upgrade that allows us to move forward, but unfortunately
            also has some consequences. In this version Qt rewrote their Platform
            Abstraction layer ( QPA ). This is the layer that implements the interface
            to the native Platform APIs. This change has the biggest impact on the
            Mac, and on Linux. On the Mac it is their final step of full Cocoa support
            on Linux it is a migration from Xlib support to xcb. Doing this allows Qt
            to fully support OpenGL GLES2. For our customers using P4V, this basically
            means that now more Graphical operations are performed by your Graphics
            Card instead of your machine's CPU. 

            By re-implementing their QPA, Qt can provide better support of solid well
            performing  styles and stylesheets. This allowed us to dramatically change
            the UI experience in P4V. All our UI definition code moved to a stylesheet.
            Instead of native styles, we've chosen one flat uniform style to unify the
            P4V experience on all platforms. We also started a quest to improve support
            for high definition monitors. ( still more work to do ). Last but not
            least, we've replaced all the icons in our product. We truly hope changing
            all this will improve your P4V experience.

            As stated earlier this upgrade has the biggest effect on Mac and Linux. On
            Linux switching from XLib to xcb eliminates support for older XServers. The
            XServer and its dependencies are driven by the distribution you use. As a
            rule of thumb any Linux distribution released 3 years ago and up should be
            fully supported. (See Supported Platforms list, above.)

            If your Linux system uses the RPM Package Manager, run the following 
            command to determine whether XCB is installed on your system:  
            rpm -q libxcb  
            If your Linux system does not use the RPM Package Manager, run this 
            command instead: apt-cache search libxcb
            or: grep "Package: libxcb" /var/lib/dpkg/status

            Because of the Linux platform restrictions imposed by the Qt framework,
            we are willing to backport major fixes into P4V 2014.1 on Linux only
            for an extended period.

            Beginning with P4V 2012.1 on Linux, users require glibc 2.5-49 or 
            greater. If your Linux system uses the RPM Package Manager, run the 
            following command to identify the version of glibc installed on your 
            system:  rpm -q glibc  

            If your Linux system does not use the RPM Package Manager, run this 
            command instead:  grep "Provides: glibc" /var/lib/dpkg/status

Installation

        Windows

            1. From the download page, click the download icon for the P4V
               Installer.

            2. To launch the installer, run the installation either by
               accepting the prompt in your Internet browser or by executing the
               downloaded file directly from the download location.

            3. As of version 2014.3, P4EXP is removed from the P4V installer.
               The first time you upgrade P4V and its components from 2014.2 or 
               earlier, P4EXP will be uninstalled. See the P4EXP release notes
               for separate installation instructions.
               
            4. As of version 2013.2, P4Sandbox is now in a separate installer,
               p4sandbox_install.exe. The first time you upgrade P4V and its
               components from 2013.1 or earlier, P4Sandbox will be removed. To
               install P4Sandbox 2012.3, use the new P4Sandbox-specific installer.

            5. As of version 2010.2, P4SCC is now in a separate installer,
               p4sccinst.exe. The first time you upgrade P4V and its components
               from 2010.1 or earlier, P4SCC will be removed. To install P4SCC
               2010.2, use the new P4SCC-specific installer.

        Mac OS X

            1. From the download page, option-click the P4V Download icon
               and save the file to disk.

            2. To launch the installer, double-click the downloaded file.

        UNIX

            1. From the download page, right-click the P4V Download icon
               and save the installation file to disk. For UNIX platforms,
               P4V is packaged in a compressed tar file.

            2. To install, uncompress the file with gzip and extract
               the runtime files into the directory of your choice.

            You can create a symbolic link that points to the P4V
            executable script.  For example, to create the link where
            the distribution files were untarred, issue the following
            commands:

            $cd /foo
            $gunzip p4v.tgz
            $tar xvf p4v.tar
            $ln -s foo/p4v-2010.2-123456/bin/p4v /usr/local/bin/p4v


Known Limitations

        P4VC has been changed such that it now depends upon the icu library
        on Linux. We have provided the libraries in the tgz under lib/icu.
        To use P4VC you must add that path to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

        Mac OS X users encounter difficulties when using P4V and the
        Darwin command-line client with the same workspace. Perforce
        recommends using the Mac OS X command-line client with P4V.
        If your home directory is on an NFS-mounted filesystem, the Offline
        feature will fail: when you attempt to go offline, P4V displays
        "unable to acquire OS lock" errors. To work around this problem,
        you can symlink the ~/.pqt and ~/.p4ob directories to the
        local filesystem.  (On Mac OS X: ~/Library/Preferences/com.perforce.p4v
        and ~/Library/Preferences/com.perforce.p4ob). The workspace files must
        also map to the local filesystem.

        P4V has been known to crash on OS X when run with the
        Zooom/2 Window Management product.

        When using the Unity Interface on Ubuntu 12.04 and higher, P4V can become
        unresponsive, with menus and context-menus no longer showing up when you 
        click on the parent menus or right-click on the items selected. This is a
        bug in the Compiz Window Manager. ( Bug #929712 : Missing context menus for
        Qt apps after minimizing the window ). Currently the only way to get around
        this problem is to log out, click the dash icon on the login screen, and pick 
        Unity2D as your user-interface. Unity2D uses the MetaCity Window Manager, 
        which does not have this problem.

        On Windows Japanese systems use code page 932. CP932 is Microsoft's extended
        version of ShiftJis; it also includes the NEC special characters. When using  
        ShiftJis on Windows, you have to instruct Qt 4.8.+ to use CP932 and the 
        extension, instead of plain ShiftJis, to avoid mojibake. You need to set the 
        following environment variable:
             UNICODEMAP_JP=cp932,nec-vdc
        Then when P4V or P4Merge runs, it will use the modified ShiftJis (CP932) 
        implementation, and apply the extension to recognize NEC special characters 
        when encoding/decoding characters.

Sunsetting Features

        P4Sandbox Configurator

        With the 2015.1 server release introducing DVCS, P4Sandbox has been officially
        sunsetted. This means the configuration tool for P4Sandbox has been removed
        from P4V as of the 2015.1 release.

        p4v*.xml

        Code complexity was a barrier to adding more functionality around being able
        to simplify P4V's UI. One large piece of that was the ability to modify the
        p4vdefaults.xml and p4vfeatures.xml to affect a users' installation. The better
        way to do this is to either set p4 properties on the server to set those
        values for users, or have them modify their preferences.

Interoperating With Previous Releases

        You can use P4V with any Perforce Server at Release 2011.1 or
        higher. The functionality available in P4V depends on the server
        version as well as the P4V version.

        In the following change descriptions, the asterisks indicate
        whether you must upgrade P4V or the Perforce Server as follows:

        ** -- requires new p4d Perforce Server program

New functionality in 2015.2/1312139

    #1263462 (Bug #72937) **
        P4V user preferences have been added for parallel sync and parallel submit. (Choose 
        Edit->Preferences->Server Data) To facilitate server administrator control over the 
        client options, a new admin property has been added:

        P4V.Features.Parallel

        The values can be:
        "Force" - P4V will use parallel sync/submit regardless of user preference
        "Off"     - P4V will never use parallel sync/submit

        If the property isn't set, then P4V will use the user preferences to ascertain
        whether to run parallel sync/submit. Note that the parallel functionality is integrated 
        into the normal operation of P4V. No special commands or interfaces, beside those 
        mentioned above, need to be used.

    #1258351 (Bug #80376)
        Auto-resolving shows a proper progress bar when the operation takes more than a few 
        seconds to complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2015.2/1312139

    #1304345 (Bug #65625)
        P4V sets P4CHARSET correctly when running custom tools. If you set P4CHARSET in your 
        environment with 'p4 set' before starting P4V, the character set WILL carry through. 
        If you subsequently unset P4CHARSET it will not be set in console windows and custom 
        tools.

    #1265243 (Bug #83419)
        Auto-resolve method now correctly saved when set in preferences.

    #1263218 (Bug #80635)
        New OSX Font "Helevetica Neue DeskInterface" isn't recognized by Qt properly,
        resulting in the Application Font preference becoming the first font found in the 
        combo dropdown. This change picks a more reasonable default font.

    #1263009 (Bug #79276)
        Fixed improper path decoding for the central settings file when a local path was
        specified in the protects table.

    #1262338 (Bug #80942)
        The default setting of the Drag and Drop preference is set correctly. This can also 
        solve what looks like problems with diffing on drag and drop.

    #1257274 (Bug #76020)
        Fixed problems on some Linux distributions forwarding the display to a Windows
        machine.

    #1256339 (Bug #80879)
        Common image types (.jpg, .gif, etc) now properly show in the Preview rev details 
        pane of the Files/History tabs.

    #1256287 (Bug #80954)
        Filenames with non-ascii characters can be sync'd, diff'd, and submitted.

    #1254771 (Bug #80614)
        Preferences for Connection Method are retained when set.

    #1251576 (Bug #77162)
        Check for updates only reports that a new version or a patch is available, not both 
        (if one or the other is true).

    #1249402 (Bug #75472) **
        The ChangeView field in the workspace dialog now correctly shows up as a permanent
        field when run against a server that has it (2014.1 or later).

    #1247833 (Bug #77117)
        Can once again print from within P4V.

    #1246966 (Bug #81266)
        Fixed a crash that occurred when Timelapse View was initiated on the same file more 
        than once before the Timelapse window appeared.

    #1245116 (Bug #81181)
        Javascript callback functions fixed in the P4JsApi.

    #1244537 (Bug #80602)
        Requesting a Swarm review with protected characters (e.g. &, +) in the description
        does not truncate the review description.

    #1244503 (Bug #80889)
        The "Edit" button in the Revision details pane will edit the selected form.

    #1243399 (Bug #80916)
        Fix crash when running P4V on the command line with the -s option against an SSL
        enabled server using Swarm.

    #1240850 (Bug #80805)
        The Depot/Workspace Tree expands previously expanded folders on startup when the
        preference to disallow expansion is not checked.

    #1239531 (Bug #80991)
        Fixed crash when changing any filter modifier from "is" to "is empty".

    #1239428 (Bug #71923)
        Previously, the submit changelist process issued a warning about the existence of 
        shelved files within a changelist in the form of a deletion inquiry. If the user
        chose Yes the shelved files would be deleted. Now, the submit process issues a
        warning in this case and the submit is cancelled. To prevent accidental deletions,
        the user must delete shelved files as a separate step before submitting the
        changelist.

    #1236043 (Bug #70810)
        Workspace tree now shows correct icons for files explicitly called out in the
        workspace view rather than implicitly included in a directory.

    #1234506 (Bug #80775)
        Disabled actions should once more grey out in the menus.

    #1234487 (Bug #67642)
        Resolve dialog has been changed such that the 'movable' part of the dialog (which 
        resizes once we get the data back in interactive mode) is the list view, not the
        bottom half where the buttons lie. This means the Resolve dialog buttons will no
        longer shift out from under the user's mouse while it's open.

    #1221505 (Bug #80273)
        Prevent 'p4 streams' from running when the streams tab was not visible. Streams tab 
        now follows other tabs' pattern of staying quiet when hidden, and refreshing when 
        becoming visible.

    #1219407 (Bug #78691)
        Fix some font issues, including choosing the wrong font, messing up default fonts,
        and changing font weights incorrectly.

    #1217329 (Bug #79103)
        Fix crash when switching workspaces and a '...' is present in the client root.

New functionality in 2015.1/1233444

    #1213168 (Bug #80074)
        This release starts an opt-in program for collecting user data on how
        users interact with our software. Upon installing this release, the user
        will be prompted with a dialog giving them the option to opt-in to our
        program. If the user chooses not to opt-in, Perforce will not gather any
        information about the user or how they use our software. If admins choose, 
        they can disable even the prompt asking users to opt in by setting a
        property on the server:

        p4 property -a -n P4.DataAnalyticsPrompt -v Off

    #1171326 (Bug #70465)
        There is now a preference to disable global refresh affecting the Reconcile 
        Offline Work dialog. Default is to continue allowing global refresh to
        update the dialog. The preference can be found on the Behavior page in
        preferences.

    #1040489 (Bug #78418) **
        The 2013 server added another integrate warning message that P4V wasn't 
        catching, resulting in integrates that didn't report failure, but failed
        to integrate files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2015.1/1233444

    #1213976 (Bug #80048)
        Fixed a crash on exit when running P4V from the commandline with the -s 
        argument. This could cause P4V to crash when launched from P4VS.

    #1209851 (Bug #73333, #73526)
        Fixed case where some of the pending changes would stop refreshing
        properly.

    #1206613 (Bug #79864)
        Re-enable Opens With... context menu option when starting P4V with the -s 
        <filepath> option.

    #1205857 (Bug #67825)
        Bugfix P4V-19201 finds the correct property from a possible list of Swarm 
        URL properties. There may be more than one Swarm URL that is retrieved
        if, for example, four Swarm servers are being authenticated by a single 
        authentication server. The fix matches on the Server ID specified through 
        the Swarm URL property P4.Swarm.URL.xxxx, where xxxx is the Server ID for 
        the desired server.

    #1145887 (Bug #79475) **
        Fixes inability to diff when using P4V against a DVCS server.

    #1130105 (Bug #79449) **
        The 2015.2 sever allows admins to change the stream folder depth to a
        variable value. P4V made some assumptions about the folder depth of a
        stream which caused some issues with this new feature. This version of
        P4V is required if you wish to use a different stream depth than the
        default.

    #1050094 (Bug #72915)
        Fixes a memory related crash on close.

    #1044752 (Bug #76922)
        Fix a crash on closing P4V or P4Admin due to improper handling of static
        object.

    #1037985 (Bug #78340)
        Restore p4vc's ability to pass arguments to the p4vc diff command. These
        arguments populate the diff dialog when it comes up.

    #1029695 (Bug #77295)
        Context menus will no longer immediately disappear on MacOSX 10.10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Minor new functionality in Patch 1 since 2014.3/998867 (GA)

    #1007534
        Added an unshelve button to the pending change dialog when it's in
        view mode. This allows you to easily unshelve the change without
        having to go to the pending change tab to find the changelist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Bugs fixed in Patch 1 since 2014.3/998867 (GA)

    #1007222 (Bug #77387)
        Large review id numbers (greater than 6 digits) are now correctly handled
        and displayed in the log pane.

    #1005908 (Bug #77339)
        When connecting to a Swarm instance that is configured with 
        require_login=true, P4V will no longer display the message:
        "Could not connect to Swarm. Host requires authentication"
        in the log pane; Swarm context menus will appear.

    #1005629 (Bug #77320)
        P4V successfully requests, updates or adds to Swarm reviews and it
        no longer displays "Host requires authentication", if a Perforce Proxy,
        Broker, Forwarding Replica or Auth server(P4AUTH) is part of the
        configuration. 

    #1004373 (Bug #75253)
        P4Exp calling DiffAgainst... will now correctly bring up the
        diff dialog in P4V consistently.

    #1001225 (Bug #77259)
        Handle trailing slash in P4.Swarm.URL by accepting URLs that
        have it or not.

Major new functionality in 2014.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #987503 **
        P4V now integrates with Perforce Swarm. This integration allows P4V 
        users to request, add to, and update Swarm reviews from Pending and
        Submitted changelists.
        This functionality is enabled by adding a server property as follows:
 
        p4 property -a -n P4.Swarm.URL -v https://swarm.yourcompanydomain.com
        where https://swarm.yourcompanydomain.com is the URL for the Swarm server.

        The timeout value can be controlled by an additional property specified
        in seconds (default is 10 seconds) as follows:

        p4 property -a -n P4.Swarm.Timeout -v seconds

Bugs fixed in 2014.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #993944 (Bug #76329, #76240, #76192, #76084)
        Fixed a few crashes on MacOSX 10.9 and above.

    #988853 (Bug #76083)
        Fixed bug where selecting the preference to "Ignore action for
        imported files" and checking the "Don't ask again" prompt would
        then subsequently ignore all requests to add a file regardless
        of whether the file was imported or not.

    #985129 (Bug #76160)
        Fixed preference that was saving non-valid characters into the 
        ApplicationSettings.xml file.

    #984498 (Bug #75752)
        When P4V loses connection with the server, it will now close the window
        when the user elects to not attempt to reconnect. Sudden disconnection
        leaves P4V in a bad state which in this case could cause crashes.


Bugs fixed in Patch 3 since 2014.2/973065
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #981336 (Bug #76488)
        Fix crash when hitting return/enter in a tab with a list that has no
        current selection.

    #981298 (Bug #76354)
        Unshelve using a stream option in the unshelve dialog will now
        show whenever the pending change's client is a stream client, and
        the current client is a stream client.


Bugs fixed in Patch 2 since 2014.2/959839
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #966249 (Bug #73724)
        File list in Submit dialog now shows correct files after a resolve.

    #965211 (Bug #74465, #75067)
        Fixed hanging problems in Open Connection dialog when accessing
        Unicode servers and/or creating new users from the dialog.

    #964400 (Bug #75923)
        For backward compatibility, we no longer set P4CHARSET=none when
        opening a terminal window.

    #963394 (Bug #76232)
        Fixed crash when creating or editing a stream while running against a
        2015.1 server.

    #963542 (Bug #76194)
        Fixed intermittent crash on Windows caused by a Qt DLL not being present.

    #963535 (Bug #75825)
        Added small padding at the top of context menu so users don't accidently
        select the first option when moving mouse down fast.

    #963335 (Bug #75842)
        New Workspace dialog can now be resized.

    #962472 (Bug #76150)
        Fixed crash on some distributions due to missing SVG Library from Linux install.

    #962961 (Bug #58623, #55583)
        gnome-terminal now P4V's first choice, if gnome-terminal not in path, p4v 
        opens konsole on the selected folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Bugs fixed in Patch 1 since 2014.2/951414 (GA)

    #958979 (Bug #74714)
        Item selection and hover colors have been adjusted so they are more visible.

    #958974 (Bug #75893, #75898, #75899)
        Fixed character mangling when connected to a non-Unicode server. The characters
        no longer appear as black diamonds with question marks. This manifested in
        multiple places, and in the case of merging, could cause data loss as the saved
        result of a merge could have corrupted characters.

    #952058 (Bug #75795)
        Fixed crash on refresh of the Pending Changelist tab that could happen when
        P4V was left running for a while.

    #950576 (Bug #75745)
        Command line p4v -h no longer crashes.

    #950790 (Bug #74442, #72783)
        P4V on the linux command line now correctly passes parameters to the
        actual executables.
        This fixes two problems: First, p4v -V now works, and second, it fixes
        the problem where the Compare Files dialog was being displayed instead
        of the P4Merge application.

    #949755 (Bug #75706)
        An error no longer appears when connecting to a non-unicode server
        and P4CHARSET is set in the environment.

    #930136 (Bug #71226, #71969)
        P4Merge no longer crashes on exit when invoked from the P4V Resolve dialog.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major new functionality in 2014.2

    #929553
        Major visual overhaul. Icons updated, colors and style modernized.
        Toolbar updated to ribbon style with common actions only. QT5 draw
        code is optimized resulting in a more responsive GUI.

    #926448
        There is no longer local help. Requesting help (either general or context
        sensitive) now launches a web browser pointing to the appropriate help page.
        Administrators can download a zipped version of the webpage from the ftp site
        which they can then stage somewhere for users to point to by adding a property
        to the server named "P4V.Help.URL" which points to the root path of the staged
        help.

    #827256 (Bug #72015) **
        Added support for global shelves. When connected to an edge server
        with shelf auto promotion off (lbr.replication=shared), a new menu
        and checkbox for making the shelf globally available to all edge servers
        will be available.
        A new icon is used to indicate shelves that are globally available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2014.2

    #943838
        P4V will now ask the user if they'd like to automatically check for P4V
        updates. The check happens roughly once a week. An icon near the status
        bar will appear if there is an update available.

    #3973977 (Bug #72987) **
        Added 2014.1 server functionality for copy -f, the ability to create revisions
        for deleted files.

    #908940 (Bug #58604)
        Partial high resolution monitor support. Text will now properly render
        on high resolution monitors. Some images still appear at normal
        resolutions.

    #900290 (Bug #71629, #74267)
        Added the ability to issue raw queries to Find in Files. Switching the
        mode to "Raw Query" now allows any syntax normally passed to p4 files.

    #885284
        p4vc can now handle the "pendingchange" command to open a pending change
        form.

    #827256 (Bug #72015) **
        Global label icon has been changed to better reflect what it means and
        to match new global shelf icon.

    #860012 (Bug #73029)
        Import/export custom tools now remember the last used directory rather
        than always defaulting to the home directory.

    #859812 (Bug #73007)
        Added "Show in depot tree" context menu option to the stream graph.

    #846282 (Bug #56381)
        Stream graph now has named favorite filters.

    #832527 (Bug #70928)
        No longer pass -f to p4 add by default. If a path contains special
        characters, a dialog will prompt the user if they really wish to add
        files with those characters.

    #820608 (Bug #35450, #36594)
        Drag and drop behavior for the pending changelist tab has been enhanced.
        There's now a preference for whether or not to do file diffs, or move the
        files between changelists. You can also now drag files/folders onto the
        whitespace area of the pending change tab to add/edit the files.

    #8200603 (Bug #72220)
        Removed checkbox for "Clear previously shelved files". The dialog was
        becoming increasingly more complex and this checkbox caused a lot of
        confusion and could result in data loss if misinterpreted.

    #819443 (Bug #72015) **
        Support 2014.1 server feature for promoting shelves between edge servers.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2014.2

    #950790 (Bug #74442, #72783)
        P4V on the linux command line now correctly passes parameters to the
        actual executables.
        This fixes two problems: First, p4v -V now works, and second, it fixes
        the problem where the Compare Files dialog was being displayed instead
        of the P4Merge application.

    #950576 (Bug #75745)
        Command line p4v -h no longer crashes.

    #949755 (Bug #75706)
        An error no longer appears when connecting to a non-unicode server
        and P4CHARSET is set in the environment.

    #943757 (Bug #75346)
        Fixed problem where an error dialog would appear over and over
        if an unknown changelist is attached to a job.

    #940146 (Bug #73194)
        Fixed crash on the Mac that happened when context clicking on
        items like a Pending Changelist when the window did not have
        current focus.

    #939161 (Bug #75244)
        On the Mac, when there are no P4V windows opened, clicking on the
        Tools menu no longer causes the application to crash.

    #937956 (Bug #71123)
        Fixed being unable to unshelve selected files when unshelving using
        a branch mapping.

    #934053 (Bug #72019)
        Stream dialog no longer accepts rich text formatting when pasting text
        from clipboard.

    #906449
        Fixed another case where a rogue p4 changes -s pending results in
        causing some pending changelists to ignore any updates, as well as
        files sometimes not getting submitted properly. This case involves
        syncing when a file is checked out.

    #905812 (Bug #67569)
        Tooltip information for "Checked out by" will now properly show up
        when using P4V translated into a language other than English.

    #905779 (Bug #68776) **
        New Copy command messages from 2014.1 server handled properly now when
        moves won't be properly propagated in the copy.

    #900285 (Bug #73879)
        Fixed logic that displays the "Unshelve using stream spec" option.
        It should now show up regardless of which stream direction the files
        would need to go. Also pre-fill the stream with current stream when
        appropriate.

    #877366
        "Don't shelve unchanged files" checkbox in Shelve dialog is now
        enabled or disabled correctly depending if the server supports
        this feature.

    #855036 (Bug #72882)
        Folder diff now correctly detects moved files, rather than marking
        all files as moved when diffing different directories.

    #835966 (Bug #72608)
        Diff against now properly reports an error when user tries to diff
        against a file's head revision when it's been moved.

    #828258 (Bug #72408)
        Fix case where we tell the user they can switch workspaces and cancel
        any running operations, but then don't actually give them the button to
        switch workspaces.

    #826739 (Bug #63349)
        Enter key should honor the double-click preference set by the user.

    #824980 (Bug #72338)
        Fixed malformed changes -s pending command when user specified a files
        path filter.

    #820157 (Bug #68997)
        Can now merge/copy to a virtual stream whenever doing a merge/copy to the
        virtual stream's base parent is allowed.

    #819889 (Bug #67590)
        When attempting to connect to a deleted workspace in the dropdown over
        the depot/workspace tree, it will now correctly be removed from the
        combo box.

    #818196 (Bug #72159)
        Fixed case where trying to branch files from a firmer stream to a softer
        stream, e.g. release to main, would fail.

    #817351 (Bug #59982)
        There's still some problems when backing out move/renames, but this change
        fixes the worst problem where the back-out would attempt to back out
        move/renames unrelated to the changes involved.

    #812233 (Bug #30388, #67255)
        Pasting text into the changelist description field will now only paste
        plain text only, not formatted text.

    #810443 (Bug #36601)
        Clearer error about non-existent workspace when attempting to connect
        through favorite connections.

    #809819 (Bug #68311)
        View paths with spaces(quotes) now update correctly when changing
        the workspace name.

    #805507 (Bug #70907)
        Suppress error dialog popups when running a revision graph that extends
        into paths the user doesn't have permission to view.

    #804318 (Bug #71841)
        Folder diff now gives preference to content diff over moved when calculating
        the row's color.

    #881076 (Bug #73410)
        Invoking p4vc with japanese extended character now works correctly when
        calling Revision Graph and Timelapse view.

    #881076 (Bug #73410)
        p4vc command line arguments for charset -C and -Q are now correctly
        recognized.

    #872614 (Bug #71967, #72654, #73526)
        Fixed problem where pending changelists would fail to update properly.
        This could result in the submit dialog not correctly representing the
        files in the changelist which could result in a data loss. The change
        would also not reflect resolved files, or re-opened files properly.

    #826022 (Bug #72111) **
        When users select "Don't shelve unchanged files" the log message
        was incorrectly saying that all files were shelved, even though
        they were not. Now we list which files were shelved and which
        were not shelved because they were unchanged.

        Added support for Greek language when character encoding is set
        to CP1253 or 8859-7.

    #782552 (Bug #70601)
        Moved/renamed files shown in new color in Folder Diff and Advanced
        Reconcile.
        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2014.1

    #796889 (Bug #71662) **
        For 2014.1 servers and later there is now a checkbox in the Shelve
        dialog that allows users to choose not to shelve unchanged files.

    #785620
        Allow the escape key to close the Folder Diff window.

    #777591 (Bug #36289)
        Add another separator in the context menus to isolate "Revert" a
        bit better to prevent accidentally reverting files.

    #763852
        Can now delete forms from the form tabs using the delete key.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2014.1

    #801082 (Bug #71273)
        Fixed problem where jobs with uppercase letters in the job field
        could not be removed from submitted changelists when connnected to
        case insensitive servers.

    #792051 (Bug #71104)
        When filtering Stream graph for "Streams with my workspaces" be sure
        to actually show all the streams.

    #791204 (Bug #71186)
        History tab now shows the correct file information when using the
        hotkey to show History tab.

    #790296 (Bug #44883)
        Fixed another case where the login prompt would appear multiple
        times, even when the correct password was entered.

    #779042 (Bug #70990)
        Fixed performance issue with extraneous fstat commands. The Files 
        tab generated fstat commands when the tab wasn't visible. This 
        could result in fstat'ing the contents of a directory when a user 
        simply clicked on a file or folder in the Depot/Workspace Tree 
        (instead, the fstat commands should be limited to when a directory 
        is expanded, or when the Files tab is visible). This could also 
        cause a very long delay in context menus coming up on folders.

    #774319 (Bug #70826)
        Fix wording on error message when Goto a changelist fails. Now uses
        generic "Changelist" instead of "Submitted Changelist" for both
        cases.

    #773293 (Bug #70806)
        Fixed case where the Shelve/Unshelve button could become enabled
        before the full operation was completed. This could, if the user had
        "Revert after shelve" or "Delete shelved files after unshelve" checked,
        result in the loss of data.

    #763241 (Bug #70499)
        Goto dialog now correctly defaults to the "Changelist" option instead
        of "Branch Mappings".

    #763236 (Bug #70509)
        Creating a new workspace now works correctly from stream graph when
        it's torn off.

    #754285 (Bug #70217)
        The Files view now stretches to fill the dialog in the shelve and
        unshelve dialogs.

    #738955 (Bug #69657)
        Prevent users from attempting to create a workspace with the "..."
        wildcard in the root.

    #737371 (Bug #69584)
        P4V no longer duplicates log messages when closing and re-opening
        a connection to the same workspace.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Bugs fixed in Patch 2 since 2013.4/768898 (Patch 1)

    #795765 (Bug #71174)
        Pending changelist files correctly update and show after shelving
        files with the Shelve dialog.

    #790345 (Bug #71178)
        Pending changelist icons correctly update when the resolve status
        changes for a file in the changelist and the Pending changlist tab
        is not visible or when files were not listed due to maximum number
        of files to display being reached.
        
    #790161 (Bug #70496)
        Fixed losing user's pending change description when saving a pending
        change instead of directly submitting when a form-out trigger which
        alters the change description is present.

    #789206 (Bug #70806)
        Fixed condition in the shelve dialog which could cause the shelve
        button to become enabled before the full operation was done. If the
        revert files after shelve checkbox was checked in this circumstance, and
        the shelve button was clicked again before the revert finished, it could
        cause a re-shelve of the now reverted files, resulting in data loss.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Bugs fixed in Patch 1 since 2013.4/760166 (GA)

    #767435 (Bug #70630)
        Fixed regression with certain integrate options being unavailable;
        for example, -v on Copy.

    #763102 (Bug #70491)
        Fixed pending changelists not refreshing properly.

    #761510 (Bug #70462)
        Fixed drag and drop diffing in the Folder History view.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major new functionality in 2013.4

    #723901
        A rich comparison of Microsoft Word (.docx) files is available
        from P4V/P4Merge through the P4Combine Web Service. After the
        Perforce administrator sets the "P4.Combine.URL" server property
        to the P4Combine Web Service URL, P4V will display a rich compare 
        of .docx files in a P4Merge window, showing differences 
        for text, images, formats, styles, tables, header/footers and many 
        other objects.

        There are two .docx compare modes: "Parent-Child" and "Siblings".
        "Parent-Child" mode is used to show how a file has changed since
        its most recent state. This mode is set when users do a 
        "Diff against revision/source/have" Ctrl-D action.
        "Siblings" mode is used when there is no direct relationship
        between the files being compared; it is set, for example, when 
        dragging and dropping .docx files.

        P4Combine is installed as part of a Perforce Commons installation.
        For information on how to install and setup the P4Combine Web Service
        see the Commons Administrator's Guide:
        http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/commons-admin/index.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2013.4

    #712285 (Bug #44815) **
        For 2011.1 servers and later there is now a checkbox option to run
        'safe sync'. This will check writeable files for content changes
        before sync'ing in order to prevent lost work.

    #711984 (Bug #65294)
        A new Streams preference lets you choose what action to take when the
        workspace icon is dragged from one stream to another. Previously P4V
        would always re-associate the workspace to the stream it was dropped
        on. Now, when dragging the workspace icon to a new stream, you can 
        reuse the current workspace (that is, re-associate or re-purpose it) 
        or use a different workspace.

        The Streams preferences "Use the same workspace and switch it between
        streams" and "Use a different workspace for each stream" were collapsed
        into one new preference, "When clicking 'Work in this Stream'". In this
        case, you can reuse the current workspace (that is, re-associate or
        re-purpose it) or use a different workspace.

    #695549 (Bug #64477, #69149)
        A new "Shelved" option in the drop down choices for "Diff Against..." 
        will diff shelved files in a pending changelist against workspace 
        files or head or have revisions.

    #693708 (Bug #68198)
        Can now horizontally scroll in Revision Graph with a mouse that
        supports horizontal scrolling.

    #692793 (Bug #67998)
        The Description dialog for moving files into another pending changelist
        remembers its size and position.

    #692029 (Bug #67582)
        A new Streams preference, "Do not warn when checking out, adding, or 
        deleting imported files", lets you choose whether to generate warnings 
        or not, and choose whether to act on imported files, or ignore these 
        actions for imported files. Now users have the option to have P4V 
        prompt every time, always check out all files, or only check out 
        selected non-imported files.

    #691964 (Bug #61407)
        Added context menu to "Get these revisions" on a submitted changelist
        which will sync the files in the changelist to the specified change.

    #691863 (Bug #43222)
        The Goto dialog no longer has separate options for Pending Changelist 
        and Submitted Changelist. There is simply a 'Changelist' option and 
        P4V determines whether it's pending or submitted.

    #691408 (Bug #44492)
        Added "Show in" option for shelved file objects.

    #690874 (Bug #66974)
        A new Streams preference, "Show pending stream-to-stream merge and copy 
        hints", turns off global istats in the stream graph. Disabling global
        istats will potentially improve perfomance. There is also a new server
        property, "P4V.Performance.AllowFullIstats", that an admin can set in
        order to centrally push the preference setting. 'On' is the default 
        value for "P4V.Performance.AllowFullIstats", and 'off' will disable 
        global istats in the graph. Users can still single-select a stream in 
        the graph and refresh the stream to run the istat for that stream and  
        get the copy/merge flow information.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2013.4

    #759428 (Bug #70332) **
        2013.2 or later servers added the ability to detect renamed files as
        part of Reconciling Offline Work. P4V now correctly identifies this
        condition and adds the move/add and deletes the move/delete. As long
        as no files are unchecked in the reconcile dialog, the files will be
        opened for move/add and move/delete. If anything is unchecked, even
        files not relating to the rename action, the files will be opened for
        add and delete instead.

    #756069 (Bug #70292) **
        The ability to unshelve files from another branch (2013.1 server) now
        works as long as the branch mapping maps the file.

    #747249 (Bug #36729, #39085)
        Pending changelist icons and context menus update correctly when the
        resolve status changes for a file in the changelist.

    #738971 (Bug #69659)
        When filtering by selected changelists in the Merge dialog, P4V
        properly integrates the changes in ascending order.

    #738906 (Bug #69629)
        When selecting "Get Revision..." from the History view, P4V correctly
        uses the currently selected folder instead of the individual files in 
        the submitted changelist.

    #736470 (Bug #69514)
        Stream graph remembers what streams you have filtered by when
        refreshing the graph.

    #734681 (Bug #69508)
        The message about what server version(s) P4V supports is now properly
        in sync with the server version being used.

    #729064 (Bug #68156)
        Non-super users in a group-owned stream can now edit the stream.

    #728435 (Bug #68712) **
        Baseless integration (p4 integ -i) is built into the 2013.2 integration
        engine. P4V hides the -i flag checkbox from merge options when talking 
        to 2013.2 or later servers.

    #724078 (Bug #67404)
        P4V handles files with multiple spaces in the filename.

    #722279 (Bug #69177)
        Files opened for add, move/add, branch and import in shelves can be
        diffed normally.

    #722134 (Bug #69379)
        P4V correctly omits revision number for shelved files opened for add, 
        move/add, branch and import.

    #721364 (Bug #69341)
        The Dashboard correctly reports workspace files needing sync when 
        import or purged files are mapped in the workspace.

    #721059 (Bug #69340)
        Preferences for the integrate dialogs (Merge/Copy/Branch) could get
        confused when different languages are used on the same machine. 
        Preferences saved using one language are honored when the language is
        switched.

    #720504 (Bug #69327)
        "Automatically get all revisions" works after editing a workspace.

    #718020 (Bug #69128)
        Move/add files doesn't show have/head revision information.

    #717776 (Bug #66908)
        Auto-submitting an integrate that involves a moved file no longer 
        fails, leaving half the move in the default pending changelist and 
        the rest in a numbered changelist.

    #716245 (Bug #61398)
        P4V honors a form-out trigger that alters a changelist description
        everywhere the user picks 'new' as the changelist to use.

    #712968 (Bug #48330)
        Drag and drop diffing of files which are opened for add works.

    #707306 (Bug #55690)
        The "Diff against Previous" shortcut works on revision objects in
        Folder Diff.

    #705838 (Bug #63944)
        The "Change Filetype" makes the default changelist the changelist
        the files already exist in, rather than 'new'.

    #705599 (Bug #63843)
        P4V can (re)create a stream that was deleted outside of P4V.

    #703817 (Bug #66275)
        P4V updates the list of files in a label (in the revision details 
        pane) while files are being added to or deleted from the label.

    #703352 (Bug #60360, #50864)
        The Pending Changelist tab now honors the preference for number of 
        forms to fetch rather than being unlimited. Also removed the default 
        changelist for other users from the display; only numbered pending 
        changelists for other users are shown. This also fixed a number of 
        refresh-related issues in the Pending Changelist tab.

    #702112 (Bug #61737)
        The Workspace dialog no longer appears when a form-out trigger fails.

    #701297 (Bug #62324, #64812)
        There are problems using hardware rendering with Revision Graph on 
        some Windows systems. To avoid confusion, the default preference on 
        Windows is now to use high-quality software rendering instead of 
        hardware rendering. This does not fix the problems associated with 
        hardware rendering, but for most, software rendering is as good, and 
        doesn't suffer the same issues associated with hardware rendering.

    #693482 (Bug #68003)
        Integrate dialogs properly handle the "invalid parent" error when
        integrating using streams that aren't compatible.

    #693014 (Bug #68064)
        Clicking the resolve buttons before the resolve has completed will no
        longer cause a crash.

    #689839 (Bug #61840)
        Shortcuts work properly when more than one Time-lapse View window
        is open.

    #689361 (Bug #53589)
        Integration dialogs no longer resize strangely between launches.

    #688437 (Bug #66941)
        Fixed hang when attempting to edit a pending changelist while files
        in that change are being sync'ed.

    #688345 (Bug #65702)
        Added "Remove from changelist" to jobs in the Pending Changelist dialog.

    #688247 (Bug #55690)
        Shortcut keys consistently work in Folder Diff.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major new functionality in 2013.3

    #662752 (Bug #66993) **
        Added 2013.1 server feature allowing users to unshelve files into a 
        different branch or stream than they were shelved from. Shelved files can
        be unshelved directly from parent stream. They can also be unshelved
        from a non-parent stream or a different depot using branch mapping.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2013.3

    #688931 (Bug #61407)
        Added a context menu option on submitted changelists to sync the
        revisions that are in the changelist. This is the equivalent of
        running "Get this revision" on every revision in the changelist.

    #687034 (Bug #67820)
        Due to a performance issue with p4 list, some changes were required
        for the sync progress dialog. Now instead of showing full file counts
        to be sync'd, it shows counts per selected path, but the percent complete
        is still accurate for the entire operation.

    #686425
        Added an optimization to eliminate redundant paths from some commands
        that P4V sends to the Perforce Server. For example, if you select a folder,
        //depot/folderA/, and also select a file in that folder, //depot/folderA/foo.txt
        and run a "Get Latest Revision" on the selection, P4V formerly issued:
        p4 sync //depot/folderA/... //depot/folderA/foo.txt. While this doesn't
        do anything wrong, it forces the server to run through the sync engine
        an extra time unnecessarily since //depot/folderA/foo.txt will already be
        sync'd by the first argument. Now the redundant path will be culled before
        the command is sent to the server.

    #681510
        Added a "Check/Uncheck all" button to the Replace Writeable Files Dialog to
        make it easier to manage the list.

    #680620 (Bug #67687, #67685, #67683) **
        Added partial support for distributed server labels. Global labels will now
        show grey when connected to an edge server. They will not be editable regardless
        of permissions while connected to the edge server, but can still be used normally.

    #677271 (Bug #66026)
        Added a preference to disable dragging and dropping streams in the stream
        graph to help prevent accidental reparenting of streams.

    #676346 (Bug #59419)
        When backing out a changelist, a very large number of file arguments could
        potentially be sent to the server (in the ensuing opened call). A new
        performance property,'P4V.Performance.OpenedLimit', will limit the number of
        files to check (as opened). The default value is 1000. If the number of
        files to back out exceeds the value of P4V.Performance.OpenedLimit, then
        a popup will tell the user that no opened check will be performed, and ask 
        if they still wish to complete the operation.

    #647838 (Bug #65710)
        Streams workspaces now have "Create/Update workspace from template" enabled.
        The view does not propagate because the view is dictated by the stream, but 
        all workspace options (rmdir, etc) are propagated.

    #647648 (Bug #536)
        Workspaces can now be multi-selected.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2013.3

    #700290 (Bug #68180)
        Fixed crash when collapsing filter widget after clearing a saved filter which
        includes extra fields beyond the defaults.

    #692149 (Bug #68138) **
        P4V will no longer attempt to run annotate -I against servers older
        than 2010.2.

    #686963 (Bug #51526)
        Doing a diff on a directory with checked out files deleted locally
        should no longer bring up unhelpful pop-up saying a temporary local
        file is missing.

    #685621 (Bug #67148)
        Triggers keyed off integrate commands will output trigger stdout to
        the log pane when running the populate command from the branch dialog.

    #685006 (Bug #67742)
        Fixed "Refresh" button in Reconcile Offline Work Dialog to run
        reconcile command when clicked.

    #684874, 680774 (Bug #67399)
        Fixed various Reconcile Offline Work Dialog refresh issues.

    #684756 (Bug #67818)
        File Path Builder Dialog no longer creates range tags for Labels.

    #683154, 642720 (Bug #66323, #49294)
        When more than one window is present, right clicking on an object in
        the out of focus window and then selecting "view" on the object used
        to bring up the form of the object in the window with focus, not the
        intended object. Fixed.
 
    #682662 (Bug #66522)
        The filters will now correctly remember their open/closed state between
        sessions.

    #682643 (Bug #65742)
        Added a confirmation dialog when deleting multiple forms.

    #679598 (Bug #67597)
        Reconcile Offline Dialog was not handling client views with "%%" 
        characters. Now it does.

    #679127 (Bug #64652)
        Attempting to create a branch mapping from inside the integrate dialogs with
        the name of a workspace or label will now fail correctly rather than giving
        an error message, then open the create branch dialog anyway.

    #678728 (Bug #63945)
        When running P4V with commandline options, or using P4VC, mouse actions 
        are no longer ignored. Double-click and context menus work normally.

    #677319 (Bug #63072, 62103)
        Base file icon is now decorated when viewing another user's default
        changelist. This fix also addresses the sometimes missing context menu
        after right-clicking on a shelved files in a pending changelist
        problem.

    #675259 (Bug #66997)
        Removed option to "Resolve Moved File" from context menus. It didn't do what
        was expected. Normal resolve trigger resolves on moved files normally, no
        need for a separate context menu option.

    #674915 (Bug #67465)
        Fixed crash when attempting to merge/integrate from a submitted changelist
        found by filtering using multiple wildcards.

    #674361 (Bug #60019)
        Max scanrow errors will no longer be supressed in some tabs, but not others.
        All tabs will now correctly report when max scanrows has been exceeded.

    #673451 (Bug #57729)
        Fixed syntax when doing a copy limited by a change number. Cherry picking is
        never allowed with copy, so syntax should always be @change and not
        @change,@change.

    #670527 (Bug #58547)
        GetSelection() now properly works in VScript and returns the current selection
        from the depot tree.

    #670394 (Bug #35394)
        Properly handle @ and # characters in workspace root paths.

    #668965 (Bug #67123)
        When propagating fixes forward in the merge/integrate dialog, we will no longer
        attempt to double-fix the job.

    #658141 (Bug #66850)
        Multi-select items in Unloaded Window now supported.

    #651377 (Bug #31442)
        Connection wizard now correctly makes directory separators Windows style
        when on Windows.

    #649552, 650046 (Bug #66542)
        Added "Unloaded" icon to stream graph. Hide icon if feature is
        invisible and disable icon if feature is disabled or server is not 
        unload capable.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major new functionality in 2013.2

    #634642 **
        Added the ability to unload/reload labels, workspaces, and task 
        streams. Unloading is done via contextual commands on the form
        objects themselves. Reloading is accessed by a separate dialog
        launched using a button on the tab for the appropriate form type.
        An 'unloaded' dialog opens with the unloaded forms allowing you 
        to then reload them.

    #627501 (Bug #21348) **
        Added a "Check for Updates" menu option under the Help menu.
        This feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled by admins.
        To disable, set the property:
            P4V.Features.CheckForUpdates = On/Off
        (which requires Perforce Server 2013.1 or later).
        
        It is on by default.
        Admins can also set a maximum version hint. We call it "hint" 
        because it does not restrict the user from using a newer version 
        of P4V against the server, but the checking for an update will 
        not report a newer version than the one set in the hint. This 
        value is set by the property:
            P4V.Features.MaxAllowedVersion = <int value>
        where the int value should be a changelist number equal to the 
        maximum allowed version. If that value is set to 60000 and the 
        latest current version is 65000, the user will get the message 
        that there is no available update if the user is already at version
        60000. If the user is at 60000 and the current live version is
        70000, but the admin has set the max value to 65000, then the user 
        will get a message that there is a newer version available, but 
        their administrator has set a different maximum, and they should 
        contact their administrator for the proper version.

        Revision graph's menu now has an 'Exit' option to quit P4V.
        
    #611801 (Bug #31961)
        Ctrl|Command+9 and Ctrl|Command+0 now switch to and swap focus to
        the depot and workspace tree respectively by default. These hotkeys
        are customizable via the Preference dialog.

        Fixed hang when attemptin to Branch files into a new changelist when a form-in
        trigger caused a failure creating the changelist.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in Patch 2 since 2013.2/679526 (Patch 1)

    #684875 (Bug #62794) **
        There was a critical bug when using the p4 list command that could potentially
        bring a server down. P4V used the list command to more accurately get sync
        file count numbers. This change removes the dependency upon the 'list' command,
        but as a result, sync preview behavior has changed somewhat. When multiply selecting
        paths to sync, instead of getting a complete sync progress, the progress indicator
        will display the current argument's counts, along with an indicator of which argument
        it's working on. I.e. If you select three folders, A (200 files), B (500 files), C (100 files).
        The progress indicator will start up and show: "Copying 200 files to workspace (1 of 3)" When
        that completes, then it would change to "Copying 500 files to workspace (2 of 3)", etc.

        Fixed crash when syncing files with two windows of P4V open 
        using different workspaces, but the same user/server.

    #657759 (Bug #66821)
        Fixed "Filter" showing up multiple times in the dropdown for default tab
        settings in the Copy and Branch dialogs. Also fixed never being able to
        properly set "Submit" as the default tab to show in those dialogs.

    #655221 (Bug #66624)
        Fix hang when a populate fails due to a trigger validation failure.

        Fix a crash when connecting to a 2010.2 server using a workspace that
        contains only non-depot files.

    #653133 (Bug #23738, #66297)
        Fixing corruption of certain Japanese characters when saving the results
        of a merge.

    #652891 (Bug #66367)
        If you install P4V in a different location than the previous install,
        it would not find the help files, or instead, display the help files
        from the previous installation if still present.

    #650866 (Bug #66579)
        Fix problem where UI can become unresponsive when attempting to use address
        bar to navigate to a path that doesn't exist in the depot multiple times in
        a row.

    #650618 (Bug #66525) **
        If you have a property set that turns off a feature in P4V, for
        example P4V.Features.Streams = Off, it correctly turns off the 
        functionality for that server. But any new connections using that 
        instance of P4V would also have that functionality turned off, even 
        if the property wasn't set for the newly-connected server.

    #647061 (Bug #66420)
        Fixed problem attempting to submit a shelved change with open files.
        If you chose to revert open files, the revert would not prompt if 
        the files had changed even when the preference to warn on revert was set.

    #643545 (Bug #66281, #66366)
        Fixed crash in the merge/copy/branch dialogs and fixed case where an
        incorrect common path could be generated from files in a changelist.

        server install which has had its streams depot created, but no
        other streams created yet.

    #636448 (Bug #65250, #41021)
        Jobs can once again be edited when the display date preference is set to
        show 'server time' without getting errors about modifying read-only
        fields.

    #634635 (Bug #65529) **
        Task streams will now only be checked by default in the stream graph
        filter when they were created by the current user.

    #634578 (Bug #63607)
        Fixed case where Ctrl|Command+d would appear to stop working periodically.
        The problem was that multiple diff windows got opened and occasionally one
        would get stuck behind P4V thus becoming un-clickable and appear to make
        P4V unusable.
        
    #633185 (Bug #65301)
        Opening windows using p4vc will no longer overwrite preferences set in
        a running session of P4V.

    #632855 (Bug #62536)
        Cancelling a submit no longer closes the submit dialog.

    #632559 (Bug #62533)
        Fixed a case where P4V could appear to hang when the user has a submit
        dialog open, then something outside P4V causes the submit to fail, and
        before the next P4V refresh occurs the user submits the change.

    #632509 (Bug #65837)
        Filter summary now correctly displays when filter text contains
        HTML characters such as '<'.

    #632280 (Bug #62410)
        Depot tree updates properly after files are branched.

    #632142 (Bug #42867)
        Map to workspace view command works with paths that contain spaces.

    #632114 (Bug #65814)
        Streams will no longer change displaying the stream root versus the stream
        nickname in the stream graph when P4V refreshes.

    #631228 (Bug #48330)
        Diff against workspace file now works for files shelved for 'add'.
        Also removed the option to diff against source on those files as there
        is no source for an added file in the server.

    #628568 (Bug #65622)
        Change access key on "Do not submit if resolved files have been
        modified" to 'u' so as to not conflict with the 'v' in "Save".

    #627975 (Bug #65580) **
        Hide option to submit a shelved change when not running against a
        2013.1 or later server.

    #627791 (Bug #62154)
        Fixed a bug when swapping between streams using the same workspace
        by editing the workspace's stream field, we were not properly taking
        advantage of the smart sync, resulting in re-syncing all the files
        even when not necessary.
        
    #625968 (Bug #64498) **
        Pending changelist badges for files needing resolves now correctly
        update. A 2013.1 server is needed to see this fix.

        Attempting to run a diff on the checked out revision in Revision
        Graph no longer causes a P4V crash.

        Disallow commas when specifying changelist and revision numbers.

    #622970 (Bug #60481) **
        Correct wording on error message when attempting to switch connection
        to an unloaded workspace. There is no p4 load command, it's p4 reload.

    #622519 (Bug #19202)
        Use proper Windows slashes on path after browsing to pick the workspace
        root folder in the workspace dialog.

        Merge/Copy/Branch dialogs will no longer produce a bad common path
        when integrating using a changelist. When this happened, it could crash
        P4V.
        
    #618966 (Bug #64999) **
        Creating a task stream that lives in a different depot than its parent
        no longer causes the stream graph to re-filter on the depot the
        task stream lives in.
        
    #618860 (Bug #64475)
        Don't ask the user twice if they want to edit a stream when it is owned
        by another user and/or locked.
        
    #618243 (Bug #62681) **
        Unloaded task streams will no longer cause error dialog spam in the stream
        graph.

        Don't mark labels unloaded when they aren't.
        
    #618011 (Bug #58586)
        Fixed crash when using "Open recent" to a connection using a streams workspace.
        
    #617636 (Bug #65697, #64247)
        P4V does not crash when running Reconcile Offline Work against
        a renamed file. This also fixes a problem where .p4ignore was not
        being properly honored.
        
    #617477 (Bug #64894)
        Corrected header for the 'Host' column in the Submitted Changelists tab.

        switching workspaces and then viewing the History tab. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major new functionality in 2013.1

    #584055, #581374, #579558 (Bug #60844) ** 
        Added support to submit shelved files in a Pending Change without 
        unshelving the files first.

    #577353  **
        Added support for 2013.1 task streams to P4V. Task streams are 
        streams that implement lightweight branching. Files are branched  
        but not actually integrated until they are promoted (by doing an 
        edit/delete/rename or add). 

    #550213 **
        The 2013.1 server provides a property table. This table can be used 
        to push some P4V settings centrally. P4V currently recognizes two 
        namespaces, P4V.Performance and P4V.Features.

        The following Performance parameters are supported:
            P4V.Performance.FetchCount = <int value>
            P4V.Performance.MaxFiles = <int value>
            P4V.Performance.MaxPreviewSize = <int value>
            P4V.Performance.ServerRefresh = <int value>

        The following Features can be turned off centrally:
            P4V.Features.Integration = On/Off
            P4V.Features.Labeling = On/Off
            P4V.Features.Jobs = On/Off
            P4V.Features.RevisionGraph = On/Off
            P4V.Features.Timelapse = On/Off
            P4V.Features.CustomTools = On/Off
            P4V.Features.Administration = On/Off
            P4V.Features.ConnectionWizard = On/Off
            P4V.Features.Workspaces = On/Off
            P4V.Features.Sandbox = On/Off
            P4V.Features.DashBoard = On/Off
            P4V.Features.P4Applets = On/Off
            P4V.Features.Streams = On/Off

Minor new functionality in 2013.1

    #584499 (Bug #62450, #62450)
        Image Time-lapse View now has its own preference page. You can now 
        choose not to launch Image Time-lapse View for any of the supported 
        image extensions.

    #577502 (Bug #62619)
        Old style preferences from P4V 2010.2 and older are no longer carried 
        over to the P4V 2011.1 and later style preferences.

    #566747 (Bug #56383, 60191) **
        Certain visuals in the stream graph are now customizable. Among them
        are the width of each stream node and whether or not to display the 
        stream name or the stream root path.

    #557991 (Bug #50610, #62895)
        Filters in the tabs of P4V have undergone some UI revamping. They now
        take up less space and are more consistent looking. Elements in the
        filter will no longer be squished.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2013.1

    #604819 (Bug #63929)
        p4vc now supports Time-lapse View launched with Japanese filenames.

    #597121 (Bug #63918)
        Loading a saved filter from the Search menu now shows correct results.

    #591795 (Bug #62708)
        The Stream Picker dialog is initialized with a depot filter used to return 
        all streams. It shows the correct filtered results now.

    #587318 (Bug #63137)
        The Copy dialog could report changes to be copied up, when such is not
        the case.

    #585164 (Bug #61653)
        Typo "WIndows" in New Workspace dialog fixed.

    #584592 (Bug #62714)
        Parenthesis no longer missing on Dashboard merge task when only one
        change needs merging.

    #584471 (Bug #62939)
        File Path Builder now reads and writes revision range correctly.

    #573606 (Bug #62711, #62325, #61803)
        P4V menus again recognized when running Revision Graph.

    #568633 (Bug #62201)
        File icons in Workspace or Depot Tree will now update after submitting
        them.

    #567874 (Bug #61256)
        Bookmarks on depot files will now be much more responsive when there is
        a hosts entry on the machine that is the same as the depot portion of
        the path.

    #553086 (Bug #60164)
        Fixed problem of double entries showing up in the Revert dialog.

    #544153 (Bug #61117)
        Fixed support for files with special characters when using reconcile.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Bugs fixed since 2012.3/567045 (GA)  

    #575623 (Bug #62509)
        Environment variables defining the Perforce connection are not
        propagated to the process running a custom tool.

    #575169 (Bug #62387)
        P4V crashes when integrating a changelist with mirrored filepaths
        in different top-level directories.

    #573970 (Bug #62340)
        Ignored files are still showing in the Reconcile dialog preview.

    #568619 (Bug #62243)
        The P4Sandbox-config utility crashes on exit when setting up a sandbox.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major new functionality in 2012.3

    #541859 (Bug #58104) **
        A progress dialog kicks in on longer submits.
        When submitting a significant changelist, P4V will report progress on 
        the submit progress. It will count down the number of files, and on 
        larger files as well the progress of that file.

    #529223 (Bug #59030) **
        P4V now supports 'p4 reconcile'. It also recognizes, and honors P4IGNORE. 
        On both Windows and Linux, users can set their P4IGNORE in their environment.
        On the Mac Desktop applications do not launch a shell, but P4V will pick it up, 
        if the environment is set using the 'p4 set' command.

    #524977 (Bug #59140)
        New Image Time-lapse tool.
        Image Time-lapse is a compelling visual tool presenting the lifetime of an image.
        It runs Time-lapse View in single revision mode and allows the user to slide through
        the history of an image, showing fading migration from one image view to another.
        It provides all functionality of time-lapse, displaying the changelists, and allowing
        the user to open the responsible changelist for more details.
        When launching it will ask the user for the range of interest, preload this range,
        and lazy load additional images.
        The images supported are : psd, png, gif, ico, jpeg, mng, svg, tga, and tiff.

    #522362 
        p4vc now supports viewing/editing form specs. The following commands have 
        been added to p4vc: 'branch', 'change', 'client', 'depot', 'group', 'job', 
        'label', 'pendingchange', 'protect', 'stream', and 'user'.

    #496906 (Bug #58234, #40179)
        Support for deep annotate (-I) support, has been added to Time-lapse View.
        Time-lapse View now has a mode that will show the original change's information for a given chunk.
        In essence, if a change was the result of an integration, rather than a direct change, it will
        display the change info for the source of the integration. Further, the rev details for that
        chunk adds a slider that allows you to independently view the history of the chunk to see
        what files it passed through via integration to arrive at the chunk being inspected.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2012.3

    #552912 (Bug #61245)
        The submit dialog can be launched from a pending changelist using the key combination 
        ctrl + enter.

    #540628 (Bug #60480)
        Added support for unloaded labels and clients.  P4V will no longer connect
        to an unloaded client. Unloaded labels can be used like normal labels.
        When filtering labels on path, unloaded labels are always discarded from the
        result set, because the server cannot retrieve this information.
        Added support for the autoreload/noautoreload for labels. A flag that can only
        be set at creation time. 
        See p4 documentation for more information on load/unload, and
        autoreload/noautoreload.

    #538702 (Bug #39629)
        The checkbox to remove sync'd files that aren't in the label view in the
        Get Revision dialog now has a sticky setting. If you uncheck it, it will 
        remain unchecked in future uses of the dialog. Default is for the checkbox 
        to be checked.

    #532912 (Bug #57357)
        Drop-down list of workspaces to swap to over the depot/workspace
        tree now persists between sessions of P4V. The list is limited to
        the 5 most-recently-used workspaces, and is sorted in
        most-recently-used order.

    #531693 (Bug #58880)
        Added double-click customization for folders in the depot/workspace tree.

    #531006 (Bug #60206) **
        Added support for ignore. A new warning dialog will notify users of files 
        ignored by add. There is also a new preference to turn off this warning.

    #529223
        Added filter to Reconcile Offline. Results can be filtered by file
        name and path.

    #517374 (Bug #56559)
        Add time zone preference.
        Forms and file times can be displayed in either server (default) or local time.            

    #517112 (Bug #58545)
        The dashboard was a potential source for Performance issues. Any kind of update
        in P4V could a refresh of the Dashboard contents. In 12.3 we changed this refresh
        policy. By default, the user asks the Dashboard to refresh by clicking the 
       'Update now' link. This is the recommended method. The user can alternatively set a 
        refresh rate. When the refresh rate expires, the Dashboard will update and refresh 
        its content.

    #507299 (Bug 58631) **
        Added a "Work in this stream..." context menu to the stream's root directory
        folder in the depot tree.

    #490243
        Depot file information will be retrieved once, and globally stored ( per server )
        This improves performance when switching workspaces, by limiting the amount of
        round trips to retrieve information already gathered.
        Especially when using Streams, switching workspaces is a breeze.

    #480071
        Added internationalization and translation support to p4vc.

        workspace to depot tree, etc) application focus will now change
        to the selected files in the depot/workspace tree correctly. This
        caused commands to not enable properly.

    #536192 (Bug #59842)
        When pressing '+' or '-' to add a new row in the Job Query Builder, 
        automatically center vertically on the new row.

        second, empty, pending changelist created when moving the files to a
        new changelist. It won't do that anymore.

    #532700 (Bug #60283, #59922)
        Unshelving a locked file behavior altered slightly. If the file is locked
        due to filetype +l, this will fail as it should. But if the file is
        merely locked via p4 lock, it will no longer fail. Attempting to submit
        the file before the previous lock is released will still fail.

    #531972 (Bug #59906)
        Fixed unexpected quit on Mac when accessing connection assistant
        from the top level menu item with no other open connections.

    #531029 (Bug #60116)

    #525932 (Bug #51645)
        Add the baseParent to the list of preferred source streams in 
        the merge/copy dialog in the following cases: 1. In merge operations 
        to dev streams with a virtual parent, when the baseParent is not the

    #520647 (Bug #51882)
        The Ok button is disabled when associating a file with a new
        pending changelist.  This prevents multiple changelists from
        being created.

    #520429 (Bug #59250)
        Remove ZeroConf from P4V.     

    #520434 (Bug #27928)

        Preference pages for the various integrate operations.
        These allow you to set defaults for Merge-Integrate, 
        Integrate flags, copy and branch dialogs. The "Set as default"
        button has been removed from the individual tabs (resolve and
        submit, integrate flags) in favor of a single button to "Set
        defaults" at the bottom of the dialog which takes you to the
        appropriate preference page. Most of the options, drop-downs,
        checkbox states, etc are now customizable to either a specific
        value, or "sticky" i.e. remember last used.

        copy the depot path however when you specify a file it copies the 
        workspace path only. So CTRL-C //depot/path/to/files/file1.txt and 
        then CTRL-V to paste it it will copy: 
        c:\user\username\workspaceroot\path\to\files\file1.txt.

        It is now possible to choose whether to add files to
        a classic or streams type depot through the add files wizard on 
        a streams enabled server. When adding files to a streams depot,
        the user can provide a name for both the newly created depot
        and mainline stream. The default classic depot is no longer deleted 
        on the server.

    #475083 (Bug #56336) **
        Against a 2011.1 or later server, In the filtering section of

        the depot tree, copy grabs the depot path, when in the workspace
        tree, copy grabs the local path on disk. Ctrl-Shift-C remains
        unchanged, it will always grab the depot path regardless of which
        tab you're in depot or workspace tree.

        consumption issue.

    #488348 (Bug #57412, #54855)
        Rollback could, under very specific circumstances, rollback an

    #439629 (Bug #53730)
        In the Find File tab, selecting "Browse..." in the submitted
        changelist field now launches a Select Submitted Changelist dialog
        with no filter by default.

    #432716 (Bug #55247)

    #470078 (Bug #55569)
        This fixes a crash when doing an integrate using a branch spec under
        certain conditions.

    #470075 (Bug #55465, #55517, #55846, #55969, #56040)
        Numerous fixes to the integrate dialog surrounding improper usage,
        or the lack thereof of the -s flag. Amongst the common cases, this
        repairs the ability to filter an integrate by a source path or
        changelist. It also restores the default of using a selected path
        as the source of the integrate, rather than the target. It also
        fixes the cases where sometimes the source/target radio buttons
        wouldn't appear even when they needed to be there.

Major new functionality in 2012.1

    #440927
        P4V is now shipped with a command-line utility, P4VC. Customers working from the
        command-line can now request P4V components individually. Install P4VC in your path
        ( e.g. where your p4 executable lives ). To see what components are supported, type
        $ p4vc help commands in the command line. p4vc runs P4V as a service. If P4V is not
        yet running as a service, it will bootstrap P4V. It will find it in the path or in
        the expected directories on Mac and Windows and it will check the actual directory
        where P4VC resides.

    #438210
        Folder Diff supports post filtering of the results on file names and
        folder paths.  Filters can be saved and stored as named filters to
        preferences.

    #436908
        P4Sandbox is integrated in P4V. P4Sandbox enables you to create and maintain
        private, local repositories. P4Sandbox replaces the P4V Offline functionality.
        From P4V customers can set up a local Sandbox server. When opening a connection
        to that local server, the gateway to the remote server will show up as a mirror
        Stream. That mirror stream can be used to integrate new data from the remote
        server to your local stream, or copy up your work from the local stream to
        the remote server, using the mirror Stream as your gateway.
        To read more about P4Sandbox, see check the documentation.
        ( http://www.perforce.com/perforce/r12.1/manuals/p4sandbox/p4sandbox.pdf )

    #412281
        New stream type 'virtual' is a stream with no physical files
        branched to the stream.  Files are pulled from, and submitted
        to the first, non-virtual parent stream - based on the view of
        the virtual stream.  This can greatly reduce the number of files
        branched when working with streams. P4V represents virtual streams
        in the stream graph, and supports merging and copying using virtual
        streams in the merge/copy dialog.

    #381577
        P4V allows the user to turn off functionality not being used.
        This will remove unnecessary clutter, and make the overall P4V
        experience simpler.

    #374973 (Bug #44246, #14842)
        Users can now set preferences for double-click behavior on
        various objects in P4V. File objects can be further customized
        based on location (i.e. in pending changelist versus in depot tree,
        etc). These behaviors are set in the preferences dialog, under the
        double-click option.

    #370630
        P4V lets the user redefine the shortcut key combination for every command.
        This allows customers to modify the existing key-stroke combinations, or
        add key-stroke combinations for commands that currently do not have a
        shortcut key defined.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2012.1

    #433408 (Bug #21002)
        Main window and several other windows in P4V now also display workspace
        name in the title bar.

    #429874 (Bug #44197)
        Submit dialog reorganized a touch. All "options" now live under their
        own section of the dialog which can be shown or hidden via a disclosure
        triangle like the other sections. Also added an option to force submit
        to always send the local copies of the file (-t).

    #425310 (Bug #21002)
        Added workspace name into most window title bars in P4V when user
        is connected with a workspace.

    #423521 (Bug #53001)
        Auto update filter when user selects a value from a browse window.

    #423094 (Bug #49644)
        Allow drag and drop of a file or folder anywhere in the filter section
        of a tab view. This will add a new path filter or replace the existing
        path filter.

    #421714 (Bug #51134) **
        Added support for the ServerID field in the Advanced tab of the workspace
        dialog.

    #421296 (Bug #52608) **
        Warn when syncing to head with StreamAtChange workspace, and provide
        option to sync to either changelist.

    #421223 (Bug #52592) **
        Pre-fill the changelist value in the "Get Revision" dialog when using a
        StreamAtChange client workspace.

    #420879 (Bug #52170)
        Added locator function for P4Sandbox. Upon clicking
        Connection->Configure Sandbox..., if the p4sandbox-config
        binary is not found in the application directory, a prompt will
        appear to assist in locating it.

    #420871 (Bug #52392, 52591) **
        Added support for StreamAtChange field in the Workspace dialog.
        Support new checkbox behavior for "Switch to workspace" and
        "Get all revisions" when editing an existing workspace form.

    #418930 (Bug #51788) 
        The merge and copy dialogs now handle virtual streams. Streams that are
        related by one or more virtual streams are treated the same as those having a
        direct relationship, so that -P is not used when constructing the merge/copy command.

    #413166 (Bug #51136) **
        There is support for the new populate command which branches and submits
        files to a new branch. It will even work without a workspace.
        In 2011.1 P4V had to create a temp workspace, run p4 copy, and submit.
        It is done now in one command.  There is a a new Stream preference which
        tells populate to integrate delete files.  This will bloat the branch
        but is useful at some sites for merging purposes.

    #408637 (Bug #51518)
        Remove Filter button from the bottom of the filter pane and filter on keystroke.

    #407626 (Bug #18596, Bug #20858)
        Add ability to find files by date submitted.
        Allow specification of multiple file name parts in find file.

    #407193 (Bug #42796)
        There is now a preference to stop prompting to get latest revision when
        attempting to check out an out of date file.

    #407056 (Bug #51647)
        There is a new Stream preference for syncing your workspace after
        it is switched to a new stream.  The preference is off by default.
        The sync was automatic in 2011.1, so users who enabled the switching
        in 2011.1 and want to continue with the auto-sync must enable this preference.

    #392377
        Revamped the Preference Dialog.
        The categories are now driven by a list instead of being presented
        as tabs. This allows us to control the size of the dialog,
        present the preferences in smaller pages, and improves both
        convenience and maintenance.

    #386586 (Bug #40883, Bug #40884, Bug# 49406, Bug #50417 )
        Files can be now reverted even if the have revision has been purged from the
        depot. A new dialog has been added to warn users of this case. This runs
        revert with the -k flag to revert the files in the server metadata, followed
        by sync -f to update these files in the workspace. The existing revert
        warning dialog now warns about all file changes, not just edit or integrate
        changes. It has also been updated to allow the user to select files for revert.

    #381514 (Bug #48677)
        The files tab in the details area for submitted changelists and
        labels now shows a textual list of files/revisions instead
        of just listing a file count.

Bugs fixed in 2012.1

    #437866 (Bug #53656)
        Similar to change 435065 [below] with similar urls. Add a warning dialog to
        appear when a new Perforce Sandbox connection is made. This warning can be
        suppressed by means of Preferences->Behavior->Prompts.

    #435065 (Bug #53655)
        Improve About dialog for p4sandbox-config utility. Include active urls for sandbox
        demo's and pdf.

    #434995 (Bug #51461)
        There's some edge cases in resolve where you can try to resolve files that aren't
        mapped, or get removed from the local filesystem underneath Perforce. When this
        happens, the resolve dialog previously still allowed you to try to resolve the
        dead files, which resulted in a crash. Now if the resolve dialog hits that state
        it disables the auto-resolve button.

    #434937 (Bug #50524)
        Preserve "Current depot or workspace tree selection" file path filter when
        exiting and reconnecting P4V.

    #433446 (Bug #53326)
        Show appropriate resolve and delete options on merge/copy dialogs based on which
        integ engine is configured and the current target client type (stream or
        classic). -Rx flags are shown when the integ engine is configured to use 3
        or the target client is a stream client. The -Dt and -Ds delete options are
        hidden when the integ engine is configured to use 3, or the target client is a
        stream client.

    #432144 (Bug #52043) **
        Fixed crash when attempting to resolve a single file opened for branch/delete
        resolve. Also fixed the selection count label showing up in the interactive
        resolve mode incorrectly.

    #431381 (Bug #53291)
        Integrate - hide irrelevant -Rx flags when server integrate engine < 3.

    #426965 (Bug #53193)
        Updated the interchanges logic in the merge/copy dialogs to handle virtual
        streams. Streams that are related by a chain of one or more virtual streams
        are treated the same as those having a direct relationship, so that -P is not
        used when constructing the interchanges command.

    #423874 (Bug #53111) **
        Fixed crash in stream graph where you had a callout bubble open when changing
        which depot you filtered on for the graph.

    #423283 (Bug #52272)
        Fixed filter not remembering stream type from previous session bug.

    #423086 (Bug #50434)
        Fixed empty fields when editing a Special Entry in the Mapping View.
        Now the fields show the current values in the dialog.

    #422255 (Bug #44892)
        Fixes bug where performing Ctrl + actions on a selected file within a submitted
        changelist window would result in the file order changing.

    #420816 (Bug #52763)
        The source stream combo box on the merge/copy dialogs only contains the
        list of preferred source streams for the operation initially. When the user
        types a valid stream name in the field outside of this list, it is then appended
        to the list of preferred source streams.

    #420815 (Bug #52350)
        Fixed integration bug where trying to branch or copy a remote depot path
        would result in a misleading error message.

    #420500 (Bug #51665)
        Fixed integration so bidirectional only gets enabled when the source
        filtering path is common to the branch source and target views.

    #418492 (Bug #49775)
        Prevent modal Preference Editor dialog from becoming a "sheet" on Mac.

    #418103 (Bug #52755)
        The preferred source stream list in the merge dialog includes release type child
        streams of the target stream with flow enabled. In the copy dialog, the list
        includes dev type child streams of the target stream with flow enabled.

    #415322 (Bug #52354)
        Fixed crash in resolve dialog when using "Select" drop-down in auto resolve
        mode and then having a failed to resolve files message dialog come up.

    #415280 (Bug #51522)

    #418424 (Bug #35294) **
        In the 2009.1 server, filelog's behavior was changed for following moves.
        This resulted in some weirdness in Timelapse View because annotate does
        not follow moves. So the data was getting intermingled weirdly. This change
        fixes Timelapse's filelog to not follow moves in the basic mode. If you
        still want moved file information, simply tell Timelapse to follow branch
        history (the branch/clock icon in TLV) and it will show all data.

    #418113 (Bug #52593)
        Resolve correctly handles stepped resolves. This is when you run multiple
        integrates into a target file without resolving between each integrate.
        Previously, bad things could happen when running the merge tool against
        a resolve record in this situation (the content of the file may or may
        not end up being correct).

    #418103 (Bug #52755)
        The preferred source stream list in the merge dialog includes release type child
        streams of the target stream with flow enabled. In the copy dialog, the list
        includes dev type child streams of the target stream with flow enabled.

    #415322 (Bug #52354)
        Fixed crash in resolve dialog when using "Select" drop-down in auto resolve
        mode and then having a failed to resolve files message dialog come up.

Major new functionality in 2011.1

    #347380 **
        Streams are a way to define containers for projects, code
        lines, and components. 
        They ensure a hierarchical approach to branching, 
        providing an out-of-the-box best practice strategy.  
        Metadata about the branch hierarchy is embedded in the Perforce 
        Server.  Streams automate the generation of client and branch 
        views.  Following are the highlights.  See the P4 User's Guide 
        for more in-depth documentation.

        - There is a new 'stream' depot type which can be created with P4Admin
        - There is a new stream spec which can be created/edited with P4V
        - Stream Graph offers a visualization of the stream structure and
          gives indications for how change should flow
        - There are new merge/copy commands and dialogs in P4V which help
          facilitate and automate the flow of change.
        - There is a new workspace dialog which supports both stream 
          and local depots.
        - The Dashboard has been updated to indicate change which needs 
          to be propagated.

        Streams require both server and client updates.

    #342373 **
        Filtering - Filters for forms has be redesigned in this release.
        The Filters have an edit mode, and a report mode. 
        Report mode takes a minimum amount of space, and makes sure more 
        real-estate is being used by data instead of filter conditions.

        Filters can now be saved, and recalled at will, allowing users to 
        preset filters name and organize them appropriately.

        Path conditions are now supported, allowing the customer to filter 
        on paths, including delimiters ( change numbers / dates /labels /
        revisions /workspaces )

        Filters now support reserved keywords:
        - Current user
        - Current workspace
        - Current depot or workspace tree selection

        These keywords define dynamic attributes provide by the connection,
        workspace, or current selection.

        The Filter widget provides 2 new assistants.
        - The 'Job Query Builder'
          Assists you in building rather complex queries.
        - The 'Path Builder'.
          Assists you in building paths (including delimiters)
        Unlike the 'Job Query Builder', the 'Path Builder' is 
        re-entrant. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2011.1

    #364097 (Bug #42177)
        P4V pops up a warning dialog, when switching of workspaces fails.

    #362837 (Bug #49233) **
        Added ability to refresh the stream graph and create a new stream 
        from a context menu on the whitespace in the stream graph.

    #360894 (Bug #19061)
        Added a preference to turn rendering of Maya files on or of. 
        Render.exe can be quite expensive, this allows a way to turn 
        off the generation of those thumbnails.

    #359175 (Bug #46468) **
        P4V's default client naming scheme now gets generated as follows:
        for stream clients:
            <username>_<host>_<stream>_<random_number>
        for non stream clients:
            <username>_<host>_<random_number>
        All temporary clients will be prepended with a ~.

    #358165 (Bug #48525) **
        Can now do "Show In Depot Tree" from stream objects, both in the
        list and in the graph view.

    #355975 (Bug #48546) **
        If you've never filtered by a depot before in the stream graph, it
        will attempt to filter based upon the current workspace's stream's
        depot. If there is no workspace, or the workspace isn't a stream
        enabled client, it still selects nothing.

    #349644 (Bug #47984)
        Fixed a problem, where P4V shows wrong file details when the client 
        uses overlay mappings.

    #333992 (Bug #47083)
        Added support for Chinese language character encodings:
        cp936 - Windows Codepage 936 (Simplified Chinese GBK)
        cp950 - Windows Codepage 950 (Traditional Chinese Big5)

    #329892 (Bug #46669)
        The prompt to sync on a new workspace has been removed from the 
        product.  The new workspace dialog gives the user the option to
        sync their workspace.

    #329273 (Bug #44541)
        The "Can't Clobber writable file" error on integrate is now 
        supported with the Replace Writable Files dialog introduced
        in 2010.2.

    #329094 (Bug #46613)
        The Find Files tab now takes advantage of the -m option for 
        depot searches.  It is limited by the same preference setting 
        for the spec lists. As in those scrolling to the bottom will 
        fetch more data.

    #327239 (Bug #46186)
        Fixed issues with context menu rendering by forcing an update 
        on the object in question.

    #326410 (Bug #15672)
        Added support for Re-Resolve with the new resolve dialog.  
        This can be initiated from files or pending changelists.

    #324100, #332117 (Bug #36198)
        When additional languages are available, users can choose
        which language to use for the application menus, labels and
        dialogs. This is set in the Preferences dialog under the General
        tab.

    #320834 (Bug #45080)
        Eliminating duplicate errors in the data array, only use 
        p4ERROR/p4WARNING/p4INFO.  See P4JSAPI documentation for details.

    #316641 (Bug #43311)
        Back out of a changelist will now treat moves properly as a move
        in the reverse order.

    #315048 (Bug #45597)
        "Locked by other user" file status is now indicated using a blue
        lock icon, which is displayed on the right side of the file.

    #303554 (Bug #44766) **
        Added support for Streams to CustomTools.
        %t is the variable presenting the selected Stream Object.

    #306523 (SIR #45094)
        P4V supports archive revisions by labeling them in file history,
        displaying a unique icon. Revision Graph has been similarly 
        enhanced.

    #302734 (SIR #38221) **
        The Resolve dialog supports resolving from a shelved file, now that
        the server permits unshelving to an open file (p4 change 299614).

    #301863 (Bug #44670)
        Allow a Pending Changelist to be attached to a job form.

    #300310 (Bug #43203)
        Added "Move All Files to Another Changelist" for Pending 
        Changelists.  This command improves performance when a PCL
        contains a very large number of files that need to be moved
        to another PCL.  It also aids moving files between two users
        sharing a client workspace.

    #299649 (Bug #18401)
        Added a context menu item "Diff Selected" when any two files or
        file revisions are selected.

    #288324 (Bug #14112)
        You can now filter the workspace tree to list only local files,
        hiding files that are managed by Perforce.

    #281537 
        Multi-select will now be honored when picking 'Show in Finder' 
        on the MacOSX 10.6 and upwards.

    #280186 (Bug # 40752) 
        Added a refresh menu item to the shelved files folder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed since 2011.1/405081 (Patch 2)

    #428929 (Bug #52968)
        The merge dialog honors the configured server integrate engine. The user is
        presented the appropriate flags for the default dm.integ.engine (2). If
        the tunable is set to 3, the dialog and execution will honor this. For more
        information about the integrate engine tunable, see the server release notes.

    #419284 (Bug #52758)
        Prevent crash while performing an integrate and a large number of error
        messages are returned from the server.

    #406340 (Bug #35294) **
        In the 2009.1 server, filelog's behavior was changed for following moves.
        This resulted in some weirdness in Timelapse View because annotate does
        not follow moves. So the data was getting intermingled weirdly. This change
        fixes Timelapse's filelog to not follow moves in the basic mode. If you
        still want moved file information, simply tell Timelapse to follow branch
        history (the branch/clock icon in TLV) and it will show all data.

    #418113 (Bug #52593)
        Resolve correctly handles stepped resolves. This is when you run multiple
        integrates into a target file without resolving between each integrate.
        Previously, bad things could happen when running the merge tool against
        a resolve record in this situation (the content of the file may or may
        not end up being correct).

    #413033 (Bug #52243) **
        P4V will no longer ignore the filtering limit (be it label, revision,
        change, etc) when using the "Branch" command.

    #408921 (Bug #50595)
        Allow a super user to unlock user client workspace through P4V.

    #408022 (Bug #51891) **
        Action resolves can now be resolved in interactive mode using the
        "Accept Merged" button.

    #407579 (Bug #51536)
        Reduce the minimum height of the Resolve dialog to fit under 800 pixels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed since 2011.1/392576 (Patch 1)

    #406340 (Bug #52017)
        When trying to do a merge/copy/branch/integ of a single file into
        a directory path, the user now gets the proper error message of
        mismatched wildcards.

    #402366 (Bug 51223)
        P4V crash when dragging a file to a branch mapping.

    #400587 (Bug #50348)
        Make host name comparisons case insensitive.

    #397213 (Bug #50557)
        Add vertical scroll area to preferences dialog if physical screen
        height is less than 960 pixels.

    #396777 (Bug #49006)
        Revision graph error with Sandbox is fixed.

    #395427 (Bug #50867)
        Form trigger failure causes crash when creating a new workspace
            using the workspace dialog.

    #395230 (Bug #514487, #59180)
        Fixed bug to back out of changelist where the move fails if the source file is not synced.

    #394780 (Bug #51163)
        P4V find file search tool results in not doing a complete search in some cases.

    #394741 (Bug #48467)
         Fixed problem when switching from Offline to Online.

    #393877 (Bug #50844)
        Cannot integrate directory with apostrophe on Windows

    #393061 (Bug #51390)
        When not running against a unicode server, P4V does not use the system locale
    for file name conversion.

    #391639 (Bug #50799)
        Crash/hang when clearing 'none applied filter

    #389370 (Bug #50985)
        Edit Stream Dialog should get default stream paths from server form

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed since 2011.1/373947 (GA)


    #387652 (Bug #50316)
        Sub-directories are now preserved when integrating individual files
        to another directory.

    #387606 (Bug #50594)
        P4V crashes when a user maps a folder to their workspace by using
        'Map to Workspace View...', applying the view, getting latest updates,
        and while syncing, the user clicks cancel or ok to close the window.

    #387419 (Bug #50745)
        Message about use of Authorization server could not be translated.

    #386882 (Bug #50594)
        Closing workspace dialog during get latest updates operation
        will no longer cause a crash.

    #386394 (Bug #49638)
        Auto update filter when user drags and drops a folder/file,
        selects a predefined value or clears a field value.

    #386266 (Bug #50607)
        Internationalization. P4V command line -t options not working 
        with translated UI

    #385882 (Bug #50734)
        The resolve dialog will no longer crash on Mac when attempting to
        interactively resolve a binary file. In addition, if you revert a
        file that needs resolve that is currently selected in the resolve
        dialog it will now correctly remove the file from the resolve list.

    #385824 (Bug #50464)
        Fixed the Add Files to Server wizard from creating and populating
        multiple mainline streams. Applies to new installations.

    #385771 (Bug #50442)
        If the user is not able to edit a stream's spec (not owner and not
        admin or super user) they will no longer be able to drag and drop a
        stream node in the graph to reparent it visually (the stream would
        not actually get reparented, but the graph would display as if it
        had).

    #385159 (Bug #50697, #49324)
        On Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 2008, a client running as 
        Administrator would fail to properly process file names in non-ASCII 
        character sets (such as Shift-JIS).

    #383009 (Bug #50503)
        When executing 'p4 move', we should not only check for the release
        version, but also check the 'System Info', and if move is enabled.
        If move is disabled, P4V should use the 'older version implementation' 
        of move.

    #382955 (Bug #49239)
        Editing workspace mappings using the tree view in the workspace
        dialog will now properly honor the full path of the directory
        rather than simply appending the last folder name on the client
        name.

    #382075 (Bug #50138)
        Crash when changing password after both password and login
        expires

    #381332 (Bug #50031)
        Entering the wrong password on a P4V login results in 5607 
        failed authorization checks against the server.

    #379328 (Bug #50415)
        Dashboard command run on a refreshAll when the dashboard is 
        not visible.

    #377660 (Bug #50295)
        P4V returns invalid password even if the correct old password is
        entered after the user typed in an incorrect old password the first
        time

    #376177 (Bug #50130)
        P4V goes into an infinite loop when user typed in the wrong 
        old password after the password expires.

    #375684 (Bug #49866)
        The initial default filters for several of the spec list 
        views have changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2011.1 GA

    #368252 (Bug #48774)
        The Access type label no longer shows when running against 
        server older then 10.1.

    #367663 (Bug #49139)
        The initial Filter on Pending Changelists for every new    
        Connection is now 'Current User/Current Workspace'.
        Clearing the filter will still give you all the Pending 
        Changes on the server. It is recommended to save a
        'Current User/Current Workspace' filter, for reuse.

    #366808 (Bug #49573)
        In the event an unknown error occurs while editing or creating 
    a stream, issue a warning dialog.

    #364965 (Bug #47303)
        Fix diff bug where the local file is chosen as base thus producing
    incorrect results.

    #364109 (Bug #48518, #49088)
        During the population of a new stream we now display error dialogs
    with specialized messages for errors that occur during the 
    following operations:
        - Workspace creation
        - Branch (including "No permission for operation on file(s)" and
                  "Protected namespace - access denied" errors.)
        - Submit
        - Workspace deletion
        - Revert

    #364109 (Bug #48527)
        When populating a new stream, we now display a busy bar dialog 
    for when files are being branched, submitted, reverted or synced
    and these operations take a long time.

    #364030 (Bug #45896)
        Changed explanatory verbiage and button text in re-associate 
    workspace warning dialog.

    #362762 (Bug #49061, #49114)
        Streams now fully supported, when running against an 11.1 server, 
    but using a 10.2 authorization server.

    #362386 (Bug #48635)
        Adding multiple new connections using 'Manage Favorite Connections'
    failed.

    #361772 (Bug #49032) **
        Clearing the depot filter in the stream graph and then immediately
    trying to filter by the same depot again will now properly trigger
    the filter.

    #361202 (Bug #48954)
        Shortcut key for Stream Graph changed to Ctrl(Cmd) + Shift + M 
    because + S conflicted with Show In Explorer on Windows. Access
    key added "t" as well.

    #359750 (Bug #47587)
        Running an integrate of any flavor on a local-only directory 
    will now translate the local syntax into depot syntax for the
    target path.

    #358115 (Bug #48753)
        Prompt to populate when switching to an empty stream.

    #358005 (Bug #48356, #48216, #47189)
        The "Do not Populate button" was a source of confusion. It is 
    now moved to the first page of the stream dialog and stated in
    the positive. Check to populate the stream.  It applies to all stream
    types, including mainlines.

    #358002 (Bug #46856)
        For new clients, default client view will once again be included
    in the dialog.

    #357885 (Bug #48180) **
        When using the stream graph, and renaming a stream the node will 
    redraw immediately with the new name, rather than having to 
    refresh the graph to get it to show up.

    #357371 (Bug #15525)
        With multiple P4V windows open on Mac, context clicking in the 
    stream graph of one while the other was the active window could
    result in opening a context menu which wouldn't work once you 
    activated the menu option.  This is now fixed. Context clicking
    in the graph will activate that window.

    #357184 (Bug #48845)
        Stream editor dialog now reflects correct "from parent" status 
    when editing a stream. 

    #357003 (Bug #48674)
        Fixed bug in which the auto submit in the merge/copy/branch dialogs
        was failing on files with special characters. 

    #356945 (Bug #48752)
        Do not show "Work in this stream" if the current workspace is 
    associated with it already.

    #356902 (Bug #48184)
        Fixed bug where "Do not populate" in the stream dialog does as 
        instructed - it does not create the branch.

    #356248 (Bug #48359) **
        Dropping a stream depot onto the stream graph filter's depot 
    drop-down will now trigger the filter to update without having
    to do anything else.

    #355914 (Bug #47900) **
        Filtering to display no streams is now a valid preference choice.
    Previously if you unchecked all streams, then came back to that 
    depot, it would then filter the "default" way (stream of current
    workspace + lineage, or all mainlines if not related to current
    workspace).

    #355837 (Bug #48673)
        Checkbox for locked clients will now be correctly checked when 
    editing a locked workspace.

    #355469 (Bug #48194)
        Integrate dialogs (Merge/Copy/Branch) will now correctly 
    determine the proper path to filter/limit by when starting
    the operation from a submitted changelist.

    #354780 (Bug #48476)
         When HistoryViewer is torn off, P4V no longer crashes when switching 
         workspaces.

    #352243 (Bug #29704)
        'Link jobs to changelist' panel in the Submit window, now remembers the 
         expand/collapse state.

    #355221 (Bug #48720)
        On Windows7 (and Vista), when running P4V as a user allowed to create 
        symbolic links (or as administrator), P4V could potentially leave behind a 
        symbolic link named %TEMP%/p4_test_symlink pointing to %HOMEPATH%.
        This file will no longer be created when running P4V.

    #354780 (Bug #48476)
        When HistoryViewer is torn off, P4V no longer crashes when switching 
        workspaces.

    #351351 (Bug #46057)
        Fix escaping of characters when dropping a path in path editors 
    in the filter widget.

    #351315 (Bug #47547)
        Fix crash on early exit from workspace selection dialog. 

    #349506 (Bug #47280)
        Remove icon from title bar of stream depot browser on Mac.

    #349505 (Bug #47946)
        Fix alignment of labels on Mac in Merge/Integrate dialog.

    #347942 (Bug #46827) **
        The undo menu option will now enable properly when there are 
    stream reparenting actions that are able to be undone.

    #347913 (Bug #49171) **
        Fixed crash when showing distinct icon for modified files.

    #342604 (Bug #47671, #47650)
        Removed the external printer preference on Unix. Qt now fully
        supports CUPS ( Common Unix Printing System ).  There is no 
    longer a need to provide an external print program, to avoid
    configuring /etc/printcap.

    #341128 (Bug #47528, #47534, #47542)
        Replace Writable Files Dialog - fixed access key collision 
        and removed items from the file context menu which could not 
        be executed from this modal dialog.

    #335444 (Bug #44883, #47902)
         Login dialog appears multiple consecutive times, even though 
         correct password entered.

        including "now".

    #302292 (Bug #43536)
        The filter for "Show only workspaces available for use on this 
    computer" now respects the root field.  Workspaces with an empty
    host field are displayed only if the root exists.

    #301592 (Bug #43748)

Minor new functionality in 2010.2

    #363615 (Bug #31545, Bug #31435)
        The integrate dialog has been updated to facilitate the flow of 
        change between streams. It is now accessed from the Merge/Integrate 
        context menu. Two new dialogs have been added to support copy and 
        branch actions. For streams and files managed by streams, the 
        dialogs will run the new merge or copy commands on servers that
        support these operations. The integrate command will be invoked
        against servers older than 11.1. The Merge/Integrate dialog
        includes the option to resolve the files being merged/integrated.
        All three merge/copy/branch dialogs include the option to
        automatically submit. Preferences from older versions of the
        integrate dialog are not honored by these new dialogs.

    #286738 (Bug #38016, Bug #43254)
        When getting a shelving error, the "Unable to shelve" dialog now
        displays appropriate files and/or error messages.

    #287709 (Bug #33081)
        Add revision number to rollback for a folder.

    #284528 (Bug #19706)
        Ctrl-D on a changelist now diffs against have revisions for 
        pending changes and against previous revisions for submitted
        changes.

    #283886 (Bug #19937)
        Update workspace using another workspace as a template

    #282245 (Bug #42756)
        Windows and Linux now use Alt-X in the File menu

    #281880 (Bug #38798)
        System info dialog now shows when performance preference overrides
        are set via the central settings file.

    #281668 (Bug #41290, 41328)
        P4V will now show the Change Password dialog when the current 
        user's password expires.

    #281619 (Bug #41215)
        Add a 'Export to' menu for non-mapped files in the depot tree.

    #281611 (Bug #39821)
        Ctrl-Shift-C copies the depot path of a file to the clipboard 
        when that file or directory is selected.

    #280501 (Bug #18564)
        Ctrl-C in the Submitted list copies the entire contents of the 
        change.  This also applies to Pending changes, Branch Mappings,
        Jobs, Workspaces, and Labels.

    #280029 (Bug #10159)
        A new context menu option appears for depot files/folders, "Add 
        path to workspace...".  This allows for quick addition of paths
        to the current client workspace mapping.  The edit workspace
        dialog will open, with the selected paths added to the view
        field separated from the old lines by a newline that gets
        stripped automatically on committing the changes.

    #277793 (Bug #24695)
        P4V now supports 'p4v -s //somepath/' parameter. This starts
        up P4V with the target parent directory open and the file
        selected.

    #276703 (Bug #17530, #30023)
        Added support for multi-select drag and drop of local files.

    #276013 (Bug #42291, #39704)
        The Log Pane has its own Font Preference.
        For certain fonts Qt substitutes missing Korean characters. 
        These substituted characters are not sizable, although the font 
        is. This threw off the sizing of the scrollbar in the log pane. 
        This can only be fixed, by the customer picking the appropriate 
        font with sizable Korean characters. To allow customers to do 
        this, we added a Font Preference to the Log Pane. ( available 
        from context menu )

    #274514 (Bug #41971)
        You can now locally configure the central settings file. Note
        that, if a central settings file is configured for you in the
        protections table, it overrides any locally-configured file.

        To specify the central settings file locally, open the
        ApplicationSettings.xml file and add an entry that defines the
        DefaultCentralSettings variable.

        Location of ApplicationSettings.xml:

        - Macintosh: ~/Library/Preferences/com.perforce.p4v/ApplicationSettings.xml
        - Windows: c:\users\<username>\.p4qt\ApplicationSettings.xml

        Example entries:

        - Macintosh: <String varName="DefaultCentralSettings">file:///Users/joe/mylocalcentralsettingsfile.js</String>

        - Windows: <String varName="DefaultCentralSettings">file://c:\Users\joe\mylocalcentralsettingsfile.js</String>

        Reminders: To enable applets, go the Preferences Applets tab.
        To determine the location of the central settings file, choose
        Help>System Info.

    #274187 (Bug #44720)
        Rollback will now use the same file type as the revision the
        file is being rolled back to. (requires a 2011.1 server).

    #273503 (Bug #37761)
        Display new icon for MoveDelete file state.
        Show warning messages in Submit dialog when files can't be 
        submitted due to deleted or moved state.

    #272380 (Bug #39614)
        Warn when about to move/rename a deleted/moved file.
        When using the Move/Rename dialog, check for files already
        moved/deleted at the head.  This step saves the user from
        discovering the failure on submit of the moved files.

    #271422 (Bug #25681)
        When P4V is idle, the automatic refresh shuts off. The refresh
        starts again, when the application is being used.

    #271331 (Bug #38640)
        Support "move -f" to resolve a file to its moved location with a
        new command "Resolve Moved File."  This is used for a file that 
        is already opened for edit, but another user/client has moved 
        the file.  Displays a dialog which identifies the source and 
        destination files for the move operation.  After confirming the
        file can be moved, and that the source file is up-to-date, runs
        the "move -f" cmd.  Once the operation completes, launches the
        Resolve dialog.

    #270537 (Bug #39262)
        P4V now accepts a -t flag when launched from the command line
        and will startup displaying the tab specified by that flag.
        e.g. 'p4v -t history' will launch P4V with the history tab in 
        view. Tab options are files, history, pending, submitted,
        branches, labels, workspaces and jobs. 
            branches, labels, workspaces and jobs.

    #270533 (Bug #18594, #29957, ##35803, #37701, #39710, #40909)
        There is a new dialog which explains how to handle "can't
        clobber writable file" error when syncing.  This includes "Get
        Latest Revision", "Get Revision..." and "Remove from
        Workspace".  A dialog shows the list of files, and offers the
        choice to force sync all or a subset of the files.

    #269928 (Bug #38582)
        Better icon alignment for dashboard icons.

    #267808 (Bug #41502)
        The files tab in the details area of the submitted changelist
        tab now gives the option of viewing either revisions or files.
        The files option is new and allows file operations on the
        files contained by the changelist. This files tab has also
        been added to the details area of the Labels list. As with
        changelists the files in a label can be viewed as revisions or
        files. The "Show the List of Revisions" from the context menu
        of a label has been removed since it is duplicated by the
        files tab and was only a textual list of the files in a label.

    #267250 (Bug #35033)
        Added a "What's New" tab when starting a newly installed version.

    #266738 (Bug #40347)
        Administrators can override P4V preferences using the Perforce 
        JavaScript API for Visual Tools (P4JsApi) in the central settings
        file without the users having applets enabled.

    #265632 (Bug #30330)
        The diff dialog can be launched from one or two labels or by 
        dropping one label on another.  The dialog is filled in with
        the appropriate options set up.

    #265448 (Bug #40469, #40644)
        Enabled saving cookies for P4JsApi.

    #263744 (Bug #31207)
        Show in Depot/Workspace will work with multiple file selection 
        in the pending changelist and submitted changelist panes.

    #257859 (Bug #38839)
        Added ability to launch an external browser from P4JsApi applets.

    #257206 (Bug #37748)
        Added P4JsApi.getPermission() to the applet API.

    #254716 (Bug #39646)
        Added ability to save downloaded images in P4JsApi applets.

    #244642 (Bug #21449)
        A jobs column is now available in File History, Folder History
        and submitted changelists.  It can be toggled on/off through the
        context menu on the list header.

    #237091 (Bug #35758, #37019)
        Anywhere in P4V where we use our specify revision limit options
        in conjunction with radio buttons will now, instead of disabling
        the options, automatically select that specify option when editing
        the limit fields.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Fixed resolve regression bug where a binary type has been 
        integrated to a text type.  The change is to use -t when the
        target is a text file since the merge can be non-textual.

    #306526 (Bug #45058)
        Fixed Revision Graph bug where it was hanging on 'archive' 
        revisions.

        folder view, including blank areas and hangs or crashes, which
        would appear after ticket expiration.

    #305451 (Bug #44540)
        An earlier change to the integrate flag logic caused the -r flag
        to not be used appropriately when integrating by a branchspec.
        We now once again do the right thing when you're attempting to
        reverse the direction of the branchspec when integrating.

    #304279 (Bug #44879) **
        Fixing another case where an error occurs with an unshelve that
        was not caught (File corrupted on transfer is the message) and so
        we deleted the shelve even though it wasn't unshelved.  We now
        catch that condition and so stop before the deletion of the shelve.

    #303243 (Bug #44751)
        Saving CustomTools no longer fails in a new installation.

        entered is not of any use, but certain trigger error messages
        will be displayed by this dialog and it is possible to cancel
        the login attempt.

        and provides a way to work on multiple job fixes in the same files.

        In P4V, you can shelve files from the Pending Changelist and Files
        tabs and the depot and workspace trees.  You can unshelve files
        from pending changelists and from the depot and workspace trees.
        You can clear the shelf from the Pending Changelist tab; to clear
        a shelf you must be the user who shelved the files or have admin 
        privilege.  Shelving requires Perforce server version 2009.2 or 
        higher.

    #214381, #216796 (Bug #35518) **
        The new dashboard tab enables you to display status and perform 
        common tasks. The dashboard tab requires Perforce server version
        2009.2 or higher. You can configure the information on the
        dashboard or hide it completely. (See information in change
        #189416 about the p4vdefaults.xml file).


    #208120 (Bug #15827)
        Support for working offline (without access to the Perforce Server).

        To work offline, you specify the directories you want to work on,
        then take your workspace offline and work normally. P4V runs a
        local server and tracks your changes, then reconciles them when you
        take your workspace online again. To minimize conflicts that can
        occur during reconciliation, work in a personal development branch
        (sandbox).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2009.2

    #221386 (Bug #36158)
        The logic that the workspace/depot toolbar menu uses to load
        connections has changed. The menu now contains:
          The workspace you are currently connected to
          Any other workspaces for the server that you have connected
            to during this P4V session
          Any favorite connection using the same port/user combination.

    #221155 (Bug #36156, #35065)
        You can turn off the offline feature and the dashboard in
        p4vfeatures.xml.

    #220465 (Bug #35900)
        Minimize the impact of p4 opened -a which will never run on "//".
        If there is no path filter (including //...) or no workspace 
        filter, we will not run p4 opened -a.  Instead we run p4 clients
        (with a user filter if specified) and add the default change for
        each of those workspaces whether or not it contains files.

    #219642 (Bug #31750)
        Most windows that you use to pick a specification (branch mapping,
        label, workspace, etc) will now remember its window size and
        splitter position.

    #218463 (Bug #30033)
        The fetch count on the connection tab in the preferences dialog
        can be set to any number.  If a  server limit is hit (maxResults,
        maxScanRows, or maxLockTime) the lists treat this condition as the
        end of the list and the error dialog is suppressed.

    #217680 (Bug #35065)
        You can turn off the Offline feature in 'p4vfeatures.xml'
        The visibility key is 'Offline', and the valid values are
        'On/Off'.

    #216865 (Bug #35826)
        The link on the Submitted Changelist tab is now one-way. When it 
        is enabled, selections in the directory tree(s) update the filter
        path, but changing the filter path no longer affects the directory
        trees.

    #215831 (Bug #24237)
        You can now assign keyboard shortcuts (hot keys) to bookmarks.

    #212197 (Bug #25885)
        Tree views now support pasting of a file or directory (CTRL+V or
        CMD+V).  If the path exists, it is selected.

    #209556
        The Submitted Changelist form has a new Back Out Change button.

    #209536, #209534, #208899, #208544
        You can now use labels as a revision specifier when creating a 
        label (Bug #28843).  Added a checkbox to exclude deleted revisions
        when adding files to a label (Bug #24925).

    208974 (Bug #22127)
        Tabs moved from the bottom of the panes to the top. The Close 
        button is now available only on the current tab. Menus are 
        easily accessible in the top corner of the tab.

    #208279 (Bug #19708)
        New checkbox in Find Files enables you to exclude deleted files 
        from the search.

    #208140
        Enhanced drag-and-drop support: to drag an object from one 
        pane to another (for example, to attach a job to a submitted
        changelist), drag the source object to the corresponding
        toolbar button. P4V displays the target pane, where you
        can drop the object.

    #205432 (Bug #32492)
        The Reconcile option is now available from depot folders. 
        You might encounter errors if the client map is overly 
        complex (for example, if sibling folders are mapped to 
        different locations).

    #204671 (Bug #24028, #31878)
        The Show in Explorer and Open Command/Terminal Window Here 
        menu options are now available from the depot pane.

    #203374 (Bug #34301)
        You can now mark files for delete without being required to 
        sync the first.  Requires 2009.1 or later server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed in 2009.2

    #263182 (Bug #37865) **
        Another edge case where unshelving could result in deletion of
        the shelved files without actually unshelving the file content.
        This could happen when attempting to unshelve a move/add action
        when, for example, the file already exists in the local drive, but
        isn't in the server yet.

    #263060 (Bug #38014) **
        OS locks on a file would cause an unshelve to fail, but this case
        wasn't being handled properly, which means it could still
        cause the shelve to be deleted even when nothing was unshelved.

    #247538 (Bug #37835) **
        Fixed an edge case where trying to shelve files from the default
        changelist while checking the revert after shelving checkbox
        could result in all files reverted without the files actually 
        getting shelved.  Also fixed an edge case of unshelving files
        that you only have "list" permission for could result in deletion
        of the shelved files without the file getting unshelved.

    #238893 (Bug #38144)
        Fixed P4V crash when switching workspace and depot browser on 
        client with null Client Root.

    #237197 (Bug #38002)
        Fixed integrating on a changelist sometimes not generating the 
        correct path for the files contained which could result in some
        files not getting integrated properly.

    #236937 (Bug #37961)
        Fixed crash when viewing preview revision details pane.  Selecting
        a folder before the preview displays for a selected file/revision 
        caused a crash.  Now it won't.

    #235640 (Bug #37723)
        When going online, do not push files from numbered to
        default pending changelist if those files are not part of
        offline's client view mapping.

    #234226 (Bug #37684)
        Move/Rename operations against servers older than 2009.1 will now
        allow special characters in the filename.

    #233268 (Bug #37578)
        Asterisks will no longer be incorrectly expanded into the percent
        code for integrate paths.

    #232095 (Bug #37440, #37279, #37211)
        Drop down selection box with pending ChangeLists comes up empty.
        Clicking on the Ok Button of the 'Add Files to Pending ChangeList'
        dialog, crashes P4V.

    #230618 (Bug #37312)
        When the FileHistory Tab is open, you have something selected
        that is not common between 2 workspaces, and you switch
        workspace, P4V could potentially crash.

    #230143 (Bug #35958)
        Take Workspace Offline can now go offline even if 'p4 diff'
        returns unexpected errors.

    #229943 (Bug #36971)
        P4V will no longer crash when switching between depot and
        workspace views with the focus on a file that is not under
        the client view of the depot.

    #229943 (Bug #36981)
        P4V no longer becomes unresponsive when attempting to print
        on Linux.

    #229244 (Bug #30516, #37233)
        Folder diff no longer marks files as unmapped or deleted if
        drive letter is uppercase.

    #228872 (Bug 36970)
        Folder Diff no longer puts files in unmapped section if path
        differs by case within workspace (nee client) root portion.
        Any drive letter in workspace (nee client) root must be
        lowercase.

    #228023 (Bug #37111)
        Fixed crash when canceling the Connection wizard after creating a
        new user.

    #227820 (Bug #37079)
        When changing your client root path, the depot directory state is
        updated correctly.

        Wizard no longer hangs on Japanese systems when uploading files 
        to a server with the Connection Wizard.

        Dashboard reliably shows when it cannot function with a pre-2009.2
        server.

    #227304 (Bug #37020)
        Jobs no longer show up as a task in the Dashboard, if JOBS as
        a feature is turned off in p4vfeatures.xml.

        Don't crash if Dashboard panel is open during failed
        Connection/Reconnection attempt.

    #226806 (Bug #36849)
        Fixed the problem that a user named with mixed-case letters
        on a case-insensitive server could not edit a group,
        even though the user is an owner of the group.

    #226777 (Bug #34784, #35225, #35315)
        Fixed bugs associated with changing workspace where the
        submitted or history tabs were holding onto a path which was
        no longer mapped in the new workspace.

    #226012 (Bug #36918)
        Fixed problem where P4V could crash when exiting and trying
        to save the Dashboard preferences.

        Folder Diff: permit CTRL+C to copy selected file path for
        non-Mac OSes.

    #224605 (Bug #36489)
        Honor spaces in path to msg_ja.txt when loading Japanese
        messages into offline server. Wrap path in double quotes if
        path contains spaces.

    #223870 (Bug #36723) **
        Admin level users should only see the delete shelved files option
        showing up on changes that actually have shelved files in them, 
        not on all pending changes.

    #223820 (Bug #36697)
        The user picker no longer comes up empty in the Favorite Connection

        Diff Against Have Revision now works for move/delete or
        move/add files.

    #221613 (Bug #34614)
        Removed an extra "/..." from the path in the folder history's
        details pane under the list.

    #220938 (Bug #35396)
        Tooltips for job descriptions limited to first 1000 characters.

    #220591 (Bug #36102)
        When coming into p4v with a newly created client, we
        now correctly set the submit options based on the client
        setting first, and lacking that against older servers, use
        the last set option.

    #220246, #220278, #220437 (Bug #35519)
        A translation error might occur when trying to integrate a
        unicode type file into a text type file and using the -t
        option to propagate the file type to the target file.
        If this occurs, the user will now be able to select
        either the yours or theirs file in the Resolve dialog.

    #220239 (Bug #36077)
        Select All in the pending or submitted changelist tabs is different
        depending on what is initially selected.  If a file, shelved file,
        revision or job is already selected, select all will select all
        other objects of the same type and only under that changelist.
        Previously, it would select all of that type under all changelists.
        As before, if a changelist is selected, select all will select all
        changelists.

    #219674 (Bug #35990)
        Fixed crash, when switching to a client without synced files,
        and then toggle between depot and workspace browser.

        Command line output for help, version and errors can now
        be translated.

    #218745 (Bug #25077)
        Fixed the filtering results such that if a path is specified
        as a filter on the Pending Change tab, the default change will
        not show if none of its files match the filter.  Before, the
        default change would always be visible.

    #218506 (Bug #35908)
        Fixed inconsistency with how Rollback showed (or not) in the
        file revision context menu.  Since one can't rollback revisions
        which are at the head, the menu item will always show and
        the dialog will produce an error if you try to rollback the
        head revision.

    #218492 (Bug #35924)
        Corrected type in the word 'Visibility' in p4vfeatures.xml.
        The block marked as Visibility will no longer be recognized.

    #217471 (Bug #28411)
        Removed autocomplete logic which expanded a numeric job name to
        the Perforce naming scheme.  The full job name must be entered
        into the "Add" field in the Submit and Submitted Changelist 
        dialogs.

    #217343 (Bug #35522, #35523, #35524, #35525, #35529, #35531, #35533, #35534)

    #217232 (Bug 35146)
        When reconnecting to server after choosing to work without
        a connection, depot tree is correctly refreshed instead of
        displaying "Updating..." and hanging.

    #217055 (Bug #35366, #35595)

       Changelist prompt no longer displayed for files that are already 
       open (for integrate, branch, or import) if you attempt to check 
       them out.

    #215171 (Bug #35255)
        P4V now correctly disallows "View Changelist" on a revision in
        a remote depot, because it cannot display the correct changelist.

    #214291 (Bug #35195)
        The link button on the Submitted Changelist tab now works properly
        when no workspace is specified for the connection.  It works
        with the depot tree only when no workspace is specified.

    #213421 (Bug #26968)
        Unchecked files in the label Preview dialog are no longer
        incorrectly included the label.

    #212114 (Bug #35149)
        Paths containing special characters no longer cause
        errors while integrating.

    #211966 (Bug #17534, #34585, #34605)
        Special characters now display correctly in the View tab, but they
        must be escaped in the View field on the Form tab.

    #211175 (Bug #35059)
        Revision details panes no longer disappear incorrectly from 
        Time-lapse View, even if you hide the P4V details pane.

        when added and the Apply button updates properly when you check 
        or unchecking pending changelists.

    #208008 (Bug #31829)
        When integrating from changelists, P4V now remembers whether 
        you last integrated up to or between the specified changelists.

    #207387 (Bug #34477)
        Windows: Attempting to write to a log file named "aux" now
        displays an error instead of crashing.

        Find previous once again works in Time-lapse View, Revision Graph,
        the Preview pane, and P4Merge.

    #204341 (Bug #34047)
        Name column no longer becomes displaced in File Details and 
        Find File windows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major new functionality in 2009.1

    #198919 (Bug #24310)
        P4V now supports a one-step version of Reconcile Offline Work.
        This feature uses a best-guess algorithm to identify files that
        need to be added, opened for edit and marked for delete.
        It also supports the standard context menu operations (such
        as revert and diff) to override any default decisions.
        An alert system warns you if there are ambiguous
        inconsistencies (files that the algorithm cannot determine
        how to handle).  P4V also includes an advanced version of
        Reconcile Offline Work that uses the Folder Diff visual
        paradigm to reconcile the inconsistencies.

    #194693 (Bug #31825) **
        P4V now supports the new "p4 move" command when connected to 
        the 9.1 server.

    #194592 (Bug #33325)
        P4V can now preview audio and video files on the Mac and Windows
        platforms. On Windows, this feature is supported by Direct Sound.
        On the Mac, this feature is supported by Quicktime. You can only
        preview local files. The file size limit for previewing does not
        affect audio and video files, because the files are streamed.

    #191404 (Bug #18854)
        You can now find text similarly to the Find feature in a 
        web browser.  Click the pane you want to search and choose
        Edit>Find... or type Ctrl-F/Cmd-F.

        Find works in most list views, form descriptions, the log pane, 
        and the preview pane (when previewing text files).  Multiple
        Find dialogs can be displayed from each "findable" place in p4v
        (as of change 201567) due to bug #34154).

    #189416 (Bug #21394, #13587, #13599, #31565, #32434)
        You can now configure initial preference settings and feature 
        availability by editing supporting XML files.

        To enable or disable specific P4V features and set initial
        preferences, copy the p4vdefaults.xml and p4vfeatures.xml from
        the examples subdirectory to the P4VResources directory (on
        Macintosh, the Resources directory).

        If these files are present when P4V is launched, P4V reads the
        settings therein to determine display settings and limits set
        to minimize impact on the performance of the Perforce server.
        The settings in these files override P4V's application defaults.
        After you edit the XML files, you must restart P4V for the new
        settings to take effect.  After P4V is launched, you can modify
        any of the settings using the P4V Preferences dialogs. Changing
        preference settings modifies the XML files.

        Four example files are provided:

        p4vfeatures.xml: configures the feature set for P4V (all
        features enabled in the included file).p4vfeatures.xml determines
        what features are enabled/visible. This is the only place where
        functionality can be turned off/on in P4V.

        basic_p4vfeatures.xml: enables a minimum set of features.

        p4vdefaults.xml: configures the default settings for 
        performance preferences and initial application appearance.
        The p4vdefaults.xml defines the default settings for some of
        the P4V preferences. When P4V reads one of these preferences,
        it will check for a default value in p4vdefaults.xml. If the
        p4vdefaults.xml is newer then the preference file, it will 
        use this value instead of the preference value. If any of
        these preferences are changed, P4V will honor the changed 
        preference value.

        basic_p4vdefaults.xml: enables a simplified application layout.

        The p4vdefaults.xml file contains two blocks:

        Performance: defines settings that control the impact of P4V on
        the Perforce server.

        Layout: enables you to define the features that are visible when
        P4V is launched, to determine its initial appearance.

        For details, consult the example configuration files.

        For information on using these XML files for automated
        deployment of P4V, see the Perforce Knowledge Base article,
        "Automated Deployment of Perforce":

    #187733 (Bugs #18717, #20230, #25909, #30025, #30489, #31718)
        The columns in the Files, Find File, and File History panes 
        are now customizable.

        To specify the columns to be displayed, right-click the column
        header bar. To change the right-to-left order of columns, drag the
        headings

        Sorting in the File in Folder tab still affects the sorting in the
        Depot and Workspace tree. The sort menu above the trees makes
        the  visible columns available for sorting. The "Sort By" menu
        item in the View menu displays the properties of any view
        that can be sorted by different columns.

        See change 189200 (below) for displaying Labels in File History.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2009.1

    #203356 (Bug #31562)
        P4V now uses higher resolution icons for thumbnail view on Windows
        Vista, when they are available.

    #200215 (Bug #30068)
        Using the Connection Setup Wizard, you can now populate an
        empty depot with  files from your local file system.

    #199802 (Bug #29090, #33820)
        Improved messages that are displayed after changes to workspace 
        root or view mapping.

    #199464 (Bug #33671)
        Added a preference that prevents expansion of the trees when 
        opening connections.

    #198762 (Bug #33007)
        The "warn on revert" prompt now is displayed only when content has
        actually changed.  Note that move/renames without any change to 
        content do not trigger this warning.

    #192906 (Bug #14310, #32340)
        The tabs in the left and right panes of the main P4V window can
        be rearranged by dragging and dropping.

    #192530 (Bug #31005)
        The File and Folder History panes now enable you to switch
        between History modes instead of setting them in Preferences.
        The three choices are standard history (filter disabled),
        Follow Branch Actions, or Follow Both Branch and Copy Actions.
        The non-standard modes display the history of a file through
        branch and/or copy revisions to their sources and include those
        source revisions in the view.

    #191371 (Bug #30675)
        The Pending Changelists of other users has a different color icon.

    #190793 (Bug #25251)
        The flags that you enable on the Advanced Options dialog for
        integration can now be saved as the default configuration.

    #190554 (Bug #32341, #18303)
        New option to Show/Hide the details pane for files.
        Additionally, a new option exists to hide the file type information
        in the Workspace or Depot trees.

    #190037 (Bug #27381)
        The X button in the filter fields now runs the filter
        when the button is used to clear the field's filter.

    #189901 (Bug #32697)
        Users with admin-level privileges can now edit and save locked
        Labels, Branches and Clients.

    #189200 (Bug #18715)
        Labels can now be displayed in the File History dialog.  This 
        feature has impact on performance, because "p4 labels" is run
        on the file path, then "p4 fstat" is run against the individual
        labels.

    #189584 (Bug #32673)
        Depot trees are no longer anchored by "//".  Depots are all top-
        level objects.  Depots and Remote Folders in the mapping view now
        have different icons.

    #188769 (Bug #24239)
        Added a ? badge to the icon for pending changelists containing files that need resolving.

    #186591 (Bug #8430)
        When opening a file for edit, P4V checks to see if the latest
        revision is synced (sync -n). If not, you are prompted to sync
        to the latest revision.  If you check out an unsynced file,
        the latest version is synced.

    #185956 (Bug #16087)
        The Submitted Changelist dialog now displays a list of the 
        revisions contained in the changelist.  This list also displays
        columns that can be sorted.  The File Diffs view can be launched
        in a separate window by clicking the Show File Diffs button.

    #185635 (Bug #32301)
        In the Pending Changelist dialog, the "Job status upon submit" 
        pull-down list has a new "same" option, which enables jobs to
        keep their current status after the changelist has been submitted.

    #185629 (Bug #12859)
        The Change Filetype menu selection now operates on multiple files
        at once.

    #184849 (Bug #31113, 31115)
        The Address bar now accepts a drag and drop from the Finder on
        the Mac.

    #184828 (Bug #13624, #25863)
        The Label command can now be run from a Revision or a Submitted
        Changelist.  This command automatically populates the Files and
        Submitted Changelist or Revision information.

    #184200 (Bug #13624, #25863)
        The following tabs, which are displayed in the Files in Folder pane, are
        now displayed in Find File: Details, Checked Out By, and Preview.

    #183946 (Bug #20035, #30874)
        The enter/return key now opens files and specs that are highlighted
        in a list.

    #183243 (Bug #17537)
        New "Check Out and Open" menu item opens a file for
        edit and immediately opens the file in the default editor.

    #182953 (Bug #22076)
        When checking out a file or marking one for Add or Delete, you
        can now specify the Pending Changelist in which it is opened.
        You can disable this prompt in Preferences.

    #182727 (Bug #20035)
        Different users can now use the same client workspace to add files to
        a pending changelist.

    #182837 (Bug #21367)
        Files Preview tab renders HTML files. Links work only if
        target files are local.

    #181974 (Bug #14670, #31188)
        A new "Move to Changelist" menu item provides you an additional
        method for moving files between changelists.

    #181681 (Bug #32012)
        The File Tooltip description now includes the #have and head
        revision numbers.

    #181481 (Bug #28236)
        The auto-resolve option in the Resolve dialog is saved to
        preferences.

    #181217 (Bug #30485)
        "Find file" path and file fields are saved to preferences.

    #179160 (Bug #31824)
        Added support for Korean language when character encoding is set
        to CP949.

    #171424
        Can now run an integrate by dragging a file/directory onto a
        branch mapping.

    Revision Graph
    --------------
    #176420 (Bug #22658)
        "Ignore" actions can now be disregarded by the highlighter. This
        option can be toggled in the Highlight menu.

    #176409 (Bug #13768)
        The graph can now be automatically sorted by either Branching
        History (the default) or alphabetically by File Path, using the new
        View > Sort submenu.  Files can still be sorted individually using
        the Move Up and Move Down commands.

    #176313 (Bug #16276, #30186)
        New Edit menu provides access to the Preferences dialog from the
        Revision Graph window.  This menu includes a new command to jump to
        the originally selected revision.

    #176249 (Bug #21725)
        A new option in the Preferences dialog limits Revision
        Graph to direct ancestors and descendants.  This option is intended
        to greatly reduce the amount of data loaded into the graph, at the
        cost of making it slightly less complete.

    #176158, #176071 (Bug #26248)
        The advanced filter dialog now includes a calendar date picker and
        a drop-down list of relative date offsets.

    #175850 (Bug #25139)
        Temporary per-file filtering settings now persist when the
        graph is refreshed.  Files that did not exist in the graph prior to
        the refresh use the default filter. All others are visible
        only if they were visible prior to the refresh.

    #174561 (Bug #26610)
        Opened files can now be displayed in the graph as "pending"
        revisions when Revision Graph is invoked from a file that is
        displayed as open.

        searched combo box's popup menu.

    #200024 (Bug #33910)
        The Pending Changelist now updates correctly after you submit a

        P4V now properly supports the Vista style for the menu buttons.

    #196436 (Bug #32964)
        Integrating by the local client root causes an expansion of path
        into the entirety of their client mapping, which no longer crashes
        for complex client maps.  Integrate no longer pre-populates the
        source path field.

    #195459 (Bug #33195)

        application one at a time.

    #194900 (Bug #31876)
        Integrating from a changelist now always uses the common change
        directory path as the source of a branchview integration, because
        using it as a target yields a "no files being integrated" error
        the majority of the time.  This fix ignores the preference of the
        limit that was last time, source vs. target.

    #194730 (Bug #33104)
        In Find File, a "select all" now selects all the files in the
        list, not just the visible files. Operations are applied
        to every file.

    #194684 (Bug #32503)
        When limiting an integrate by branchview, the Integrate dialog now
        correctly remembers whether you last integrated using the limit as
        a source or target.

    #194522 (Bug #32979)
        The Details, Files, and Jobs panes on the Submitted Changelists dialog

        selected.

    #194390 (Bug #33086)
        The Submitted Changelist and Job panes are no longer refreshed
        in edit mode, which consistent with other types of spec panes.

    #194387 (Bug #33044)
        Jobs which are part of a Submit are now properly refreshed.

    #194386 (Bug #31129)

        Changelist pane.

    #194325 (Bug #32437)
        The Qt libraries provided with P4V have been renamed to avoid

Major new functionality in 2008.2

    #164057 (Bug #23944, #19423, #20397, #16230, #25258, #26746, #23640,
            #15686, #23928, #23008, #21443, #23624, #17826, #25257,
            #27766, #28344, #21105, #23195, #22977, #21590)
        The Integrate dialog has been redesigned to clarify the information
        that must be entered.

        Integrate now supports multiple file and directory integration.

        Integrate dialog: revision range specification is more explicit.
        When the detail is hidden, a summary is displayed. The default
        specifier has been changed from revision number to changelist.

        Advanced flags have been moved from the main dialog to a popup
        dialog. To display the popup, click "Advanced Options...".
        Also, when the -f (force) option is selected, a warning is
        displayed in the main dialog.


        Integrate dialog: added the ability to save file sources and
        targets as a branchview.


        When doing an integrate using a branchview, restricting the
        integrate to specific paths as a source or target, the dialog now
        determines which side of the branchview the paths lie on and
        provides feedback if the specified path will not be integrated. The
        source/to radio buttons align themselves the direction of the
        branchview arrow and link to it, and changing one changes the other
        to clarify the direction of integration.


        The Integrate dialog remembers the five most-recently-used
        branchviews.


        Users can now do a folder diff based on the selected branchview.

        Dialog no longer closes if there are errors in the integration.


        Integrate preview has been revamped.

           Instead of a text window that simply lists all the server
           output, it now displays a side-by-side view, with the "from"
           revision list on the left and the "to" revision on the right.

           Types of integrate are color coded as follows:

           errors = red
           branches = beige
           merges = blue

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor new functionality in 2008.2

    #168317 (Bug #24827)
        New preferences for the file history view to show the
        direct history, the branch history (-i), or the copy history (-h).

    #165662 (Bug #10255, #11807 #19718)
        The Log window now displays more information summarizing the
        results of operations. In the Preferences dialog "Show p4 commands
        in status pane" has been split into "Show p4 reporting commands
        (dirs, filelog, fstat, etc.)" and "Show p4 command output for file
        operations". Both of these Log options are turned off by default.
        To enable them, go to Edit -> Preferences... and check the two
        related checkboxes under Log options on the General tab.

    #165011 (Bug #17773)
        "Show timestamp in the log pane" is now saved as a preference.

    #165005 (Bug #13776)
        "Open for Delete" is now isolated in the context menus for files
        and folders.

    #164158 (Bug #29593)
        Column widths and sorting options are now saved for the file list
        in the Submit Changelist dialog. The settings are automatically
        stored. This feature is not backward-compatible.

    #164116 (Bug #28312)
        Column widths and sorting options are now saved for File Details,
        Find File, File History, and Folder History. The settings are
        automatically stored. This feature is not backward-compatible.

    #163639 (Bug #16127)

        "Use IP-specific tickets when logging in" in the Preferences
        dialog under the Connection tab.

        possible depot paths

    #162993 (Bug #25405)
        P4V now provides Print Preview functionality. This feature enables
        you to specify the columns to be printed.

    #162745 (Bug #18163)

        from files, directories and file revisions where appropriate.

    #162476 (Bug #25804, #29676, #27574)
        File paths now honor wildcards in the filters for submitted
        changelists, pending changelists, labels, and jobs. The asterisk
        (*) character is NOT translated. If there is an asterisk in your
        path name, repeat it (**), and P4V escapes it when sending the
        command server.

    #162399 (Bug #30368) **
        P4V now supports Zeroconf (service registration and discovery).
        Using Zeroconf, you can register the Perforce Server as a named
        multicast DNS service, enabling you to browse a list of available
        servers in the Connection Dialog, the Connection Wizard, and the
        Favorite Connection Editor. P4V use the service name instead of
        server:port to connect to the server. For more details about
        Zeroconf, see the 2008.2 server release notes.

    #162260 (Bug #30380, #24177)
        Tooltips for file icons now display a legend. Branch and integrate
        icon badges are now displayed in pending changelists and the
        depot and workspace trees.

        Users with administrator privilege can now unlock files locked by
        other users.

    #161539 (Bug #17959)

        in P4V. To delete pending changelists, your connection settings
        must include a valid client workspace.

    #161238 (Bug #14932) **
        Descriptions of submitted changelist can now be edited by the
        changelist creator and by users with administrator privilege. Your
        connection settings must include a valid client workspace. This
        feature requires Perforce Server version 2007.2 or above.

    #160523 (Bug #12093)
        New context menu for "Switch to Workspace" added to the Workspaces
        tab.

    #160356 (Bug #16038)*

        The Show/Hide submenu of the View menu now has an option to toggle
        the tab bars in the tree pane and the right-hand pane.

    #160253 (Bug #10161)
        A locked status column has been added to the Labels and Branches
        tabs. A check mark indicates that the specification is locked.

    #160209 (Bug #15176, #17520, #31688)
        A new Rollback to Revision(s) feature has been added and is
        available for file revisions, submitted changelists, and labels. A
        file deleted at the head revision can be rolled back to the
        previous revision. Use an empty pending changelist for rollbacks.
        Additionally, a Rollback limited to only the files contained in
        changelist can be performed by selecting Back Out from the menu
        displayed when context clicking on individual changelists.

    #158879 (Bug #13133, #29809)
        The Jobs pane now remembers the last used filter and automatically
        filters on that expression when reopening the pane.

    #157842 (Bug #11524)
        The P4V command line accepts but does not require the -c client
        flag, enabling you to connect without specifying a workspace.

    #157753 (Bug #25669)
        The Help -> Show Connection Info now displays client version
        information.

    #157353 (Bug #29730)*

        sessions.

            now correctly list the appropriate Bookmarks.
            (Bug #21508)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
     #112926
       On Windows, custom tools no longer launch 'cmd.exe /c'
       when you select 'Run tool in terminal window'. This change might
       break tools scripts that use command shell internal
       commands. Replace such commands '<command>' with 'cmd /c
       <command>', or run your script from a command shell.

     #102352
            As of 2007.1, P4V  no longer supports servers below version 2002.2.

        #108683
            When viewing the pending changelists of other clients, files
        marked for add now appear in the changelists of other clients.
        These files might be obliterated or opened for add/branch.
        Because these files are not local nor are they in the depot,
        no context menu is available for them.  (Bug #22345)

        #108510
            Added new preference for turning off integration history
            on the History Tab, which is off by default.  You enable
            the preference on the General Preference Tab.
        (Bug #22275)

        #108261
            P4V now has the ability to configure third-party merge tools by

            Added support for new client spec submit options in the 6.2 server.
            See server release notes.  Reopen now applies only to submitted
            files. In 6.1 P4V treated this option the same as "Leave unchanged
            files."

        #107377
            Folder Diff now displays the revision number to which the
            workspace file is synced.  Files that are marked for
            delete are visually differentiated from files that were
            deleted outside of Perforce's control.

        #104710
            When you select "New" changelist from the Integrate
            dialog as the target changelist, P4V now presets the

        Revision Graph
        --------------
        #110816
            Branched revisions with multiple contributors are now treated as
            "add" for consistency with merges that have multiple contributors
            (which are treated as edits).  Prior to server release 2006.2, it
            was not possible for branched revisions to have multiple
            contributors.
            (Bug #22933)

        #103915
            The dotted arrows that indicate an "ignore" have been made sparser
            to better distinguish them from the dashed-dotted arrows that
            indicate a "merge".
            (Bug #21711)

        #103910
            An example of a downgraded branch ("branch with edit" or
            "add from") has been added to the Legend tab.
            (Bug #21708)

        #103795
            The "Filter Options" drop-down has been replaced with a
            button that brings up the "Advanced Filter Options"
            dialog, which replaces the "Default Filter Options"
            dialog from 2006.1.  A "Clear Filter" button has been
            added to the toolbar, which is equivalent to checking the
            root node of the filter tree.
        (Bug #21649)

        #103136
            Additional options have been added to the "highlighter"
            functionality, in the form of a drop-down that lists several
            different highlighting actions.
            (Bug #17229, #18927, #20739)

        #103105
            Arrows that indicate a "merge from" or "edit from"
            integration are now  dashed and dotted rather than solid,
            to distinguish them from other types of integration
            arrows.
        (Bug #17445)

        #103100
            When the lineage of a revision is highlighted on the graph, the
            arrows corresponding to that lineage are colored green to
            match the highlighted revisions.

        #102850
            There is now a "Refresh" button on the toolbar which fetches
            any new revisions/files that have been added after the graph was
            built, and re-initializes the graph to its default view and filter
            settings.
            (Bug #20745)

        #102818
            Revision Graph can now operate on folders.  Integration records
            are not traced in this mode. Instead, a timeline of the
            folder's content is displayed.  Because every single revision in
            the path is displayed on the graph, caution is advised when
            using this command recursively on a large folder.
            (Bug #14595)

        #102810
            The specific revision range that contributed to a merge will now
            be indicated as a bracket connected to the merge arrow.
            Integrations which implicitly include all prior revisions are
            displayed as open-ended brackets.  Brackets are hidden completely
            when the "Compressed Integration History" option is on.

        Time-lapse View
        --------------
        #96271
            When a chunk is selected, it now displays a yellow line under
            the scale showing the extent of that chunk's lifetime.

Major new functionality in 2006.1

        In release 2006.1, P4V has been enhanced to save column width and
        sorting preferences for the specification panes. If you are running

            The integrate dialog has undergone some significant changes.
             - You can now browse for a filepath in all the places that accepts one.
             - Browsing for a branchspec now brings up a dialog that resembles
               the branch pane from the main p4v in that you can see details of
               the selected branch below the list.
             - After selecting a branchspec to integrate with, the view is shown
               in the branch specification tab of the dialog.

               from within the integration dialog.
             - The mechanism to limit the integration by path (-s) has been changed to
               a clearer set of widgets.  It is now one path, with a radio button
               designating whether you wish to use the path as a source limitation
               or a target limitation.
             - Limiting the integration by rev/change/label/etc is now clearer as well.
               Checking the boxes now indicates you wish to limit the integration.
               - If no limitation specified, it will now by default do the expected
                 behavior of earliest unintegrated to latest unintegrated revisions.
             - The optional flags are now hidden behind an expansion button.
               P4V will remember the state of if the shown/hidden options.

               option to send the integration into a new pending change.  New is
               set as the default change currently.

Major new functionality in 2005.1

        THUMBNAIL VIEWER

        Image files in the "Files in Folder" and "History" views can be
        displayed as thumbnails. Users can choose between three sizes of
        thumbnails: small (80x80), medium (120x120) and large (160x160).
        The thumbnail viewer requires the installation of the thumbnail
        generator to display depot files. (Bug #13576)

        NEW RESOLVE DIALOG

        The new resolve dialog suggests resolve options, allows you
        to open and diff the yours/theirs/merged files, and gives you
        the ability to display the file history and Time-lapse View
        of the yours and theirs files. (Bug #13592, #15675)

        NEW SUBMIT DIALOG

        The new submit dialog lets you hide/expand different sections of
        the dialog, change the post-submission job status for jobs
        attached to the changelist, and explicitly delineates what is
        required for the submit to be allowed. (Bug #13583)

        NEW DIFF DIALOG

        The new diff dialog allows you to diff many different
        versions of files (workspace copy, latest revision, have revision,
        or any specific revision.) (Bug #13563)

        CUSTOM TOOLS (WINDOWS ONLY)
        Automate the process of running commands or launching other
        applications from within P4V. Through the Custom Tools dialog,

        integrate and delete actions for you. (Bug #8231)

        PREVIEW TAB

        The files detail pane and the file revision detail pane contain a
        new preview tab that displays the contents of the selected file
        for both text and image type files. (Bug #15081)

        FILE DETAIL PANE

        The file detail pane contains information related to a specific
        file in either the Depot or Workspace tree. The view consists of
        three tabs: "Details", "Checked Out By" and "Preview". (Bug #9656)

        ADDRESS BAR

        The new address bar lists the path of the currently selected file
        or folder in the Depot/Workspace tree view. The address bar can
        also be used to copy and paste file/folder paths for fast
        navigation to a specific file or folder.  (Bug #15011)

        EXPANDED OPEN/OPEN WITH OPTIONS

        With the new "Open With" option, you can open files using any
        application you choose.  File revisions and files not currently in
        the workspace can now be opened for viewing.
        (Bug #8877, #11987, #13577, #16513)

Major new functionality in 2003.2

        SINGLE WINDOW APPLICATION LAYOUT

        The Files window, Specification window, and Log window have been
        combined into one window.  Windows can be torn off from the main
        window to mimic the 2003.1 layout, but the default behavior is to
        have one window, minimizing clutter and reducing confusion.
        (Bug #8710)

        REDESIGNED "OPEN CONNECTION" DIALOG
        The dialog has been redesigned to make connecting to a server
        easier.  Users can browse a list of existing users and workspaces,
        or choose to create a new user or workspace from within the dialog.
        The auto-fill feature that users found confusing has been removed.

        CONNECTION SPECIFICATION
        A connection window is now identified by a twin (port and user)
        instead of a triplet (port, user, and client), making it easier
        for a single port/user combination to switch between clients.
        (Bug #8470)

        FILES IN TREE VIEW
        The Workspace and Depot Tree views now display the files that are
        contained within the folders.

        TOOLBAR
        A new toolbar has been added to the top of the Connection window
        with shortcuts to frequently used features.

        STATUS BAR
        A new status bar has been added to the bottom of the Connection
        window.  This status bar displays folder and file paths when the
        mouse hovers over either a folder or a file.

        FIND FILE FEATURE
        This feature allows a user to search for a file in which all or
        part of the name is known, but not the exact location.
        (Bug #11175, #11176)

        GO TO SPEC
        This feature allows the user to go directly to the detail view of
        a specification when the specification name or number is known.

        SPEC DETAILS AND REVISION HISTORY
        Specification Details and Revision History are now tabbed panes,
        instead of separate windows.

        "TEAR OFF" FUNCTIONALITY
        The Tear Off feature is used to preserve a view in the Files in
        Folder, Revision History, and Spec Details views. When a user
        tears off a view, the contents of that view are displayed in a
        new windows.


Minor new functionality in 2003.2

        #44264
            P4V now has a File -> Cancel Operation menu item that will
            interrupt the current server operation. (Bug #8058)

        #49380
            Users now have the option of having a timestamp displayed in
            the log pane. (Bug #11616)

        #52282
            The Pending Changelist creation dialog is more intuitive.
            (Bug #10470)

        #52499
            The labelsync dialog has been redesigned. (Bug #12875)

            Performance improvements, including better handling of
            operations against large filesets (Bug #13174, #13911).

        #53191
            Newly created directories now show up in the depot pane.
            (Bug #11640)

            (Bug #13013)
