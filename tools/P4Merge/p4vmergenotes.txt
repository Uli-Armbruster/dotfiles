        P4Merge 2011.1 works with a Perforce Server at Release 
        2006.2 or higher and can be run standalone from the command line.

        Documentation

        P4Merge Release 2011.1 is documented in help files that are 
        embedded within the program.

        User Audience

        P4Merge is an end-user application designed for software 
        developers. P4Merge can be run stand-alone and does not require a 
        Perforce Server or P4V.

        Installation

        Windows

        From the download page, download and run the P4V 
        installer.  The P4V installer includes P4Merge.

        Mac OS X

        From the Perforce download page, option-click the P4V Download icon
        and save the file to disk. To install P4V and P4Merge, double-click
        the downloaded file. P4Merge is included in the P4V.dmg file.

        To run P4Merge from the command line, issue the following command:

        <path to p4merge>/p4merge.app/Contents/Resources/launchp4merge <args>

        NOTE: The launchp4merge command-line binary must be run from the
        above location. You can create a link, alias or shell script that
        points to this location.

        Unix

        From the download page, right-click the P4V Download icon and save
        the p4v.tgz installation file to disk. 

        P4Merge is included in the p4v.tgz, packaged in a compressed tar
        file.  For example:

        $cd /foo
        $gunzip p4v.tgz
        $tar xvf p4v.tar
        $ln -s foo/p4v-2010.2-123456/bin/p4merge /usr/local/bin/p4merge

        p4merge <args>

        note: all files passed to P4Merge on the command line must be
              existing files or an error will occur citing the non-existing
              file as invalid.


        Compatibility of Client and Server Versions

            Unless stated otherwise you can operate any release 
            of a Perforce client application with any release of 
            a Perforce server, but any functionality that is new 
            in 2010.2 requires you to upgrade the client 
            application and possibly the server as indicated by 
            asterisks in the descriptions below.

            * -- requires new p4merge client program
            ** -- requires new p4d server program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Image Diff Problems

      (Bug #40137) 
      The image diff highlight feature is a very resource intensive
      operation since it compares every pixel between the images.
      Depending on the user's machine resources, they could experience
      a slowdown and/or hang if the highlight feature is used in very
      large images or the machine used has limited resources.

      (Bug #29477) 
      When diffing 48-bit color .TIFF files (16 bits for each channel
      r/g/b), the image depth is reported to be 32 bits.

      (Bug #29587) 
      When diffing .GIF files, the image depth is always reported to be
      32 bits.

      (Bug #29497) 
      Only RGB formatted files are supported in the image diff tool. If a
      CMYK formatted file is diffed, its format is reported as RGB.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor new functionality in 2011.1

        #333992 (Bug #47083) *
            Added support for Chinese language character encodings:
            cp936 - Windows Codepage 936 (Simplified Chinese GBK)
            cp950 - Windows Codepage 950 (Traditional Chinese Big5)

        #324100, #332117 (Bug #36198) *
            When additional languages are available, users can choose
            which language to use for the application menus, labels and
            dialogs. This is set in the Preferences dialog.

        #322256 (Bug #46050) *
            Added support for diffing images of the following formats:
            TGA, Photoshop, 3DSMax, and Maya. Maya image diffing requires
            Maya to be installed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new functionality in 2008.1

        #149390 (Bug #21119) *
            P4Merge adds support for diffing image files. You can diff the 
            following image file types:

            * BMP
            * GIF
            * JPG, JPEG
            * PNG
            * PBM
            * PGM
            * PPM
            * TIFF
            * XBM
            * XPM

            For details about how to diff images, refer to the P4Merge online help.

            Note: you can create plugins to add support for other image file 
            types. For technical details, check the Trolltech web site.

            Known Limitation

            P4V displays thumbnails for both image files and related file 
            types such as Photoshop and Maya. You can diff images in P4V by 
            dropping one thumbnail on another.

            However, P4Merge does not support all file types for
            which thumbnails are displayed. For example, if you drop a 
            Photoshop icon on another Photoshop icon to diff the files,
            P4Merge determines that the file are not supported types
            of image files and attempts to diff the files as text.

        #151214 (Bug #24980) *
            P4Merge now has a full-featured help viewer that includes indexing,
            searching, bookmarking and printing.

            P4Merge now checks to see if the initial character set is okay 
            for all files. If it's not, P4Merge tries the System 
            charset. If the System charset is okay, P4Merge selects 
            System as the default in the Charset confirmation dialog 
            drop-down list to indicate that the files are most likely 
            text and System is a better choice. The Charset 
            confirmation dialog now has a "Yes", "No" and "Cancel" 
            buttons instead of the "Continue..." and "Cancel" buttons.

            longer a resize of the window when moving between displays 
            of different sizes. There is now the ability to restore to 
            a position that spans more than one display. Lastly, there 
            is only a resize on restore to fit the desktop if the

            disconnected).

            mode, you can refresh and re-diff files without restarting the
            P4Merge window. In merge mode, if the merged result has been
            modified, a warning prompt is displayed, stating that, if you

        #89587 (Bug #18908) *
            ESC key now closes the Choose Files and the Preferences dialogs on
            Windows.
